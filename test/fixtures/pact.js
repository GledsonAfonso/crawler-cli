<p dir="ltr">There was a car, my parent’s or my uncle’s, no doubt, parked in the middle of the gates, at the foot of a long driveway, leading up to Hillsglade House. Symbolic, really, of everything that had gone on for most of my life. Symbolic of everything I had walked away from.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My uncle… I was guessing it was my uncle, had parked the car at the entrance of the driveway to force everyone else to find a place to park.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I looked down the length of the street. The property was framed by a short stone wall, shoulder height, along with an elaborate iron fence of roughly the same height, shaped into curling vines with metal points at set intervals. It had been covered in some black paint or coating, but rust and peeling paint made for a mottled texture. ‘No parking’ signs, a good distance in every direction. I was already regretting coming. <em>Damn me</em>, I thought, not for the first or second time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Further down the street, a few of the locals had stopped on a corner to talk. Odd, how they kept looking at me.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Their eyes on my back, I pushed my motorcycle, guiding it through the gap between car and fence. I set it on the lawn, leaning against the inside of the fence.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I wasn’t in a rush. I had made promises to myself. I wouldn’t get caught up in their tempo. Taking my time, I removed my helmet, wiped the sweat from my forehead and scalp. Putting my hands in my pockets to be sure I had my keys, I felt paper crumple. I went through my pockets, sorting out the change, bills and receipts I’d hastily pocketed at a rest stop along the way</p>
<p dir="ltr">Procrastinating.</p>
<p>Looking up at the namesake hill, I could see the house. Not big, but it drew attention because of the way it looked down on the two-theater podunk town. It wasn’t dark, and it wasn’t ominous. Barring a slightly overgrown garden, trees that had grown well beyond the quaint, tidy little decorations they might have been when the house was built, and the railing, it was nothing more than a nice house. I’d dated a wannabe-architect at one point, a brief-lived fling. I didn’t remember much, but I didn’t feel confident labeling the place as Victorian. Three stories, with a one-room tower standing one floor higher, off one corner. Gray-painted wood siding, decorative ‘lace’ in carved wood beneath the eaves and around the railing on the porch, tall, narrow windows with open shutters.</p>
<p>I pulled off my jacket, then my sweatshirt. Unlocking and lifting the seat of the motorcycle, I retrieved the shirt I had stowed away. Leaving the other clothes behind, I buttoned up the shirt over a black t-shirt while I made my way up the driveway.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If my uncle had parked nearer to the house, he could have spared himself and his family the walk. But no, the inconvenience he could pose to everyone else was apparently the top priority. I wasn’t surprised. I would have been stunned if there <em>hadn’t</em> been anything like this.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My boots were heavy on the floorboards of the porch as I approached the front door. I stopped to wipe them on the doormat. No ‘welcome’ was printed on the mat. Instead, there were stencil images of roses and thorny stems, as well as the initials ‘R.D.T.’</p>
<p dir="ltr">It fit, somehow. No consideration to the guests, only self-aggrandizement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The door was unlocked. I kicked off my boots and made my way past the front hallway and into the actual house, tucking my shirt into my jeans as I went.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My lingering impressions of the house were soon banished. Only a house. Books lined shelves in nearly every room with an available wall, some old with cracked spines, some new, recent bestsellers. It was all sorted more like a library than a home, clearly by some arrangement of age and alphabetized.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Anachronistic. That was a good word, to describe it. Old and new. A box of colorful cereal sat between the toaster and television in the kitchen, across from a small table with a crimson, lace-edged tablecloth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A litterbox, with a toy. Not a dirty litterbox, to look at it, which struck me as odd. I couldn’t imagine my family had emptied it. It didn’t fit them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I reached the end of the hall, and I could hear voices from upstairs. A crowd, angry, not shouting, but saying hard words, loaded words. I sighed, putting my hands in my pockets, and made my way up.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Photographs. Not a single family picture, I noticed. Instead, there were pictures of nature, blue and green to contrast the dark-lacquered cherry floorboards and furniture, the burgundy curtains. It made for a startling intensity, but it was jarring, overly saturated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When I crested the top of the stairs, I saw them. One family, divided into four factions, all dressed in black.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Jesus fuck,” Paige said, her eyes going wide.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The prodigal son returns,” Uncle Paul said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That was the last coherent thing I made out before it devolved into a mess of bickering.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Ten to one he needs the money for drugs.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If you want to talk about that sort of thing, Steph, we could talk about Ellie.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Fuck you, Irene,” Ellie practically spat the response at her aunt. “You don’t know anything. Uneducated bitch.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hard words, drawing lines in the sand, striving to establish new ground rules, to hold on to perceived advantages, to garner new ones, or strike at weak points.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For three years, I had been gone. All of this, it had been going on when I left, and it was continuing now.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>It never stopped.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Nine cousins, spread into three camps. Uncle Paul, his ex-wife, and my Aunt Irene.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My Uncle Paul had a wealth of kids, four by his first wife, two by his second. The oldest of my cousins had a child of her own, while his youngest was twelve. Six in all, with Paige and her twin brother Peter in the middle. Those two would just be partway into college, I was pretty sure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Paige looked like she wanted to approach me, but doing so meant getting between Uncle Paul and Aunt Irene, as they pointed fingers, digging at each other.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I tuned the words out. It had been a while, but I knew this refrain already.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Aunt Irene had kids, but I only saw two. Molly was close to me in age, and I’d known her well, once upon a time, but I hardly recognized her now. She was so preoccupied she barely seemed to notice me, her fingers twisting into one another in her lap, her leg bouncing a nervous rhythm that her mom tried to still with a touch. It seemed to be rubbing off on her little brother, who was looking equally anxious. They all had brown hair, and Molly was paler than usual, and the black dress she wore only made it worse.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Uncle Paul’s family, his first wife Stephanie, my Aunt Irene, each with their respective kids. Three groups, three factions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The fourth group would be ‘mine’, for lack of a better word. My cousin Paige had recognized me before they did. My parents.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They approached, and I saw that my mom was holding a baby, swaddled in a blanket. I wasn’t good at judging the ages of babies. I’d left three years ago.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Everything alright?” my father asked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“S’alright,” I responded, not taking my eyes off the baby.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You’re not in trouble?” my mother asked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“No trouble,” I said. “You’d be surprised.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Except for leaving to spend the night with friends and never coming back?” my dad asked. I responded with a glare.  He changed the topic, “I can’t help but notice you got tattoos.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">I looked down. The shadows of my tattoos were visible through the sleeves of my dress shirt. I pressed my sleeve down so it was flat against my arm, making the tattoos, clear. “Watercolor tattoos, by friends. An artist friend I owe a lot to offered to outline them, another friend inked them.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">I had set rules for myself, to avoid getting caught up in this energy, yet I was baiting my father. I could see him squirm, wanting to say something. Question was, would he be willing to criticize the tattoos so soon after my homecoming?</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What?” I asked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m glad you’re safe,” he said, with almost no affect. “You know I never harbored any ill will.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I know you didn’t.” I held my tongue before I added anything else. <em>That wasn’t ever the problem, was it?</em> I shrugged, my hands in my pockets, and looked at the baby. “Who’s this?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Ivy,” my mother said. “She’s one and a half.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Hi Ivy,” I said. She responded by pressing her head against our mother’s shoulder. “Busy soaking it all in, kiddo, so you have some good stories to tell your therapist, ten years down the line?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Blake,” my dad said, the word a warning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Without looking away from Ivy, I kept my voice calm, the tone almost light, so the vibe wouldn’t upset her. “How hard did you look, Dad? Mom? I got in touch with some of my old friends, you know. Seeing what happened. My friends, the only ones you actually called, said you stopped asking about me after a month.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You were almost an adult, and the police weren’t interested or helpful. We called around, trying to figure out where you were staying, but nothing turned up. I’m not sure what we were supposed to do.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">I smiled a little as Ivy reached out for my offered hand. Her hand seized my index finger, and I wiggled it, ‘shaking’ her hand. <em>Besides, why devote any more attention to your son, when you could just start over? Have that beautiful baby girl you wanted, right? </em></p>
<p dir="ltr">“You’re quiet,” my mother said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Nothing to say,” I said. “Is it okay if I send Ivy some presents for the special occasions? Birthdays, Christmas?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You don’t get to pick and choose,” my dad said. “Family isn’t a halfway thing.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Nevermind, then. If it’s one or the other, I’m out. Again.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Blake!” my father said, raising his voice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ivy recoiled at the sudden shout, withdrawing her hand from my finger as her face screwed up. Tears imminent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Damn it. It was too easy, to lash out, to retaliate, to get sucked into this atmosphere.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Sorry, Dad. Sorry, Mom. My bad, Ivy,” I said, my voice soft. I didn’t wait for a response. I walked past them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I stopped in my tracks as a door opened and Callan stepped out of the nearest room. Aunt Irene’s eldest. A man in white scrubs followed him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Ellie?” the man asked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Callan was Irene’s eldest, second oldest of the cousins. If Ellie followed after him, then they had to be going down the list, seeing the cousins in order of eldest to youngest. I watched as Ellie stood, looking out of place and deeply uncomfortable in a dress that didn’t suit her. Her eyes had thick eyeliner, her lips had lipstick too red for her complexion. Her slouched posture and narrow, flat-chested figure evoked mental images of a weasel. She was visibly nervous, but not in the same way Molly was.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The door wasn’t the hollow plywood door that you saw in most homes. It was wooden, through and through, and it closed behind Ellie with a heavy thud.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“No kidding. <em>Blake</em>?” Callan asked, as I started to walk around him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Hey,” I responded.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You’re wearing <em>jeans</em>? <em>Paint-covered</em> jeans? <em>Now</em>?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">I looked down at the jeans, the lap striped with narrow streaks in various colors, then met his eyes, shrugging. “Doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Why the hell did you come?” he asked. “Most of us thought you were dead or something.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Got a call,” I said. I glanced back at my parents. <em>The lawyer found me, alive and well, without much trouble.</em> “I was wondering how the family was doing, and figured this was maybe the last time we’d all be together. Thought I’d check in, see how things were, say what needed to be said.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If you think you’re going to worm your way in-“</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If I was, do you think I’d be wearing these jeans?” I asked. More exasperated than anything, I told him, “Fuck off, Callan. Save your energy for attacking the others. I’m a non-threat. Promise.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">He scowled a little, then summarily fucked off. He took a seat on the deacon’s bench, beside Molly. His hand settled over hers, and he leaned over to murmur in her ear.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I made my way out of the small crowd that had gathered around that heavy wooden door.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Paige fell into step beside me as I walked to the end of the long hallway. I stopped by the narrow window, where the dim light of the setting sun filtered between the curtains and through the sheers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Jesus fuck,” she said, for the second time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Hey, Paige.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">She reached out, arms extended for a hug, and I flinched. I stepped back, and nearly knocked a picture off the wall behind me as I bumped into the wall.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She looked stricken. Her arms dropped to her side. Her hair was done up in a french braid, and she looked as comfortable in her clothing as her older sister hadn’t. It was how she’d always been. Prim, proper, preppy. She was almost into her twenties, now, but I could see where she could easily be at home in the world of ties and pantsuits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“No, I just-” I said. “I… reflex.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">I made myself reach out to hug her. It was clumsy, not natural in the slightest. Her head banged against my ear hard enough to be painful, her arms squeezed me in excessive care.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What happened?” she whispered, as we parted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I knew what she was asking, but I answered a different question instead. “I didn’t see any reason to stay, so I left.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You ran away.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I always think of little kids leaving with a bundle on a stick, when I think of ‘running away’.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">I shrugged. The shrug was getting to be habitual, to the point where I felt like my attempts to take all of this in stride were more <em>acting</em> than reality.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Not a word, not a call? I mean, I know we weren’t close, but I thought maybe you’d say something, let me know you were okay.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I didn’t make it hard to find me. I figured I’d go back or whatever if anyone bothered enough to track me down. But they didn’t, so I didn’t.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Did you <em>go</em> someplace, or…” she trailed off, as if afraid to broach another boundary, as she’d done with the sudden hug.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I was on the streets, just for a bit. It was worse than you’d think. A bit ago I met people, and I got help. I know how lucky I am, that I made it this far.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was odd, talking about it with someone who didn’t know the story already.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I could see a look in her eyes that I was familiar with. Pity, but not quite pity. An attempt at understanding that couldn’t succeed. There was no explaining just how bad it had been without having to explain why I hadn’t gone home. Pride, of an odd sort that drove someone <em>down</em> instead of raising them up.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To distract her, to end that inquisitive look, I commented, “I’m doing okay enough that I treated myself to my first big nonessential purchase.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">I had to lean against the wall, to angle myself so I could see it, leaning against the inside of the fence. I pointed, then stepped out of the way.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“A bike?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“And the license and insurance. It’s about the shittiest, smallest, cheapest bike ever, and it’s used, but that doesn’t matter. It’s mine. What are you up to? University?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Second year. Business, hopefully law a bit down the road, if I can finagle it.”  She showed me her crossed fingers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You still keep in touch with the people from high school? Shannon? Miracle?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Mira. She’s finally going by a different name. No longer a testament to why immigrants shouldn’t let their kids choose their English names. She still asks about you, you know?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“At least someone did,” I said, smiling a little.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Paige looked like she was going to punch me, then stopped short. Remembering the issue with the hug. “<em>I</em> did, you jackass. Fuck.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Molly stood from the bench and approached us.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Here we go,” Paige said. She smiled, quirking her shoulders as she showed an uncharacteristic excitement. A little bouncy, even. “Us three, back together after… nine years?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Ten,” I said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Paige was a year older than me, Molly a year younger. We’d always hung out, back in the days when the family had gotten together.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Molly didn’t look happy, though. She hugged her arms against her body. She still looked almost ill.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You okay?” I asked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I want this to be over,” Molly said. She leaned against a doorframe. A moment later, she stood, shifting position. Restless.</p>
<p>“I remember how we used to make up stories about this place,” Paige said. “Gruesome ones.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Molly said, hugging herself tighter. “They weren’t all made up. That bit about great-grandpa and great-grandma being related?”</p>
<p>I shivered a little. “Thanks. Thank you for that reminder.”</p>
<p>“The duel where one of our ancestors murdered someone?” Molly asked.</p>
<p>“Killed,” Paige said. “I don’t think it counts as murder if it’s during a duel.”</p>
<p>“Semantics,” Molly said.</p>
<p>“I <em>love</em> arguing semantics,” Paige said, smiling mischievously. “Don’t get me started.”</p>
<p>The murmur of conversation further down the hallway dwindled. Silence, and the sound of footsteps.</p>
<p>Ellie, making her exit.</p>
<p>“Paige and Peter,” the man in scrubs said.</p>
<p>Paige’s eyebrows went up.</p>
<p>“Lumped in with the twin,” I noted.</p>
<p>Paige forced a smile to her face. “I’m a little terrified. Here goes. Wish me luck.”</p>
<p>“Paige,” Molly said.</p>
<p>Paige hesitated.</p>
<p>“Don’t. I can’t explain it. It would sound dumb if I did, but don’t take the offer.”</p>
<p>Paige frowned.</p>
<p>“Paige?” the man in scrubs asked. Peter was standing next to him. Blond, like Paige, the same height and build, even the same general shape to his face. But when Uncle Paul and Aunt Steph had split up, each one had taken one of the twins. Peter was rougher-edged, at a glance, somehow older, and very much like Ellie, who had joined him in going to their mom, in how uncomfortable he looked in more formal clothes.</p>
<p>He and Paige entered together.</p>
<p>Molly and I were left alone, at the end of the hallway. The volume of conversation in the hallway gradually rose. Whispered words to allies, barbs directed at enemies.</p>
<p>When I spoke, my words were closer to a whisper, a murmur. “Hey, Moll? What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“Don’t know if you remember, or heard, but my mom moved us here. So we’d be closer.  Trying to get an advantage. So Callan, me and Chris, we’ve actually been here regularly. Usually when mom invited herself over.”</p>
<p>“I figured it was something like that,” I said.</p>
<p>“I don’t think Callan really gets it, but he moved a few years in. Chris and I have gone to school here. There’s a <em>vibe</em>. Too many things that don’t fit. Strangers knowing who I am and not liking me right off the bat. Does that make sense?”</p>
<p>“Sure. It’s about the property.”</p>
<p>“More than the property. It’s about old ladies glaring at me. Kids going after Chris on the playground, and it’s too quick and too mean for me to feel like it makes any sense. Feeling like I’m surrounded whenever I’m outside. Like a third of the people around here have decided we’re their mortal enemies.”</p>
<p>I could remember my nights on the streets. Finding a place to set up camp, out of anyone else’s way. Even with the city lights, it was hard not to feel like danger was lurking just out of sight, waiting until my eyes were closed. In quieter areas, where the glow of the city hadn’t been there, where deeper shadows could have hidden <em>anything</em>, the feeling had been all the more intense.</p>
<p>Twice, I’d even been right. Both times, it had been people. The worst types of people. I still had scars. Some were physical.</p>
<p>I could imagine how Molly might feel, facing a watered down version of the same situation. Being bullied by a whole community, being somewhere where anyone could be hostile without the slightest provocation. Being a focus, even. I could remember the looks the people on the corner had given me as I’d pulled up.</p>
<p>“You <em>are</em> their mortal enemy, Molly. <em>We</em> are. It’s a small town, people obsess over the smallest things, and this is a <em>big</em> deal to people. When you’re alone, feeling vulnerable to begin with, it’s scarier. I don’t want to make it out to be less than it is-”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I mean,” she interrupted.</p>
<p>“It’s… what it is, Molly. Trust me. Small communities have done <em>scary</em> stuff before, with little rhyme or reason. You’re spooked, you have a reason to be spooked. It’s legit. But don’t lose sight of the issue at the root of this whole business.”</p>
<p>She looked so abjectly <em>miserable</em>, standing there, restless, nervous.</p>
<p>“It’s almost over,” I tried to reassure her.</p>
<p>“I’m-” she started, then she stopped. She glanced back. “I’m going to go sit. I need to get my head clear before my turn comes up.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m really glad you’re okay, Blake,” she said. She managed a smile.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” I responded.</p>
<p>I watched her make her way back to her seat.</p>
<p><em>Damn them. Damn it all</em>.</p>
<p>I could feel the anger stirring, again. Anger at my uncle and aunts, at my parents, at everything here.</p>
<p>It got worse instead of better, as I waited.</p>
<p>When the door opened and both Paige and Peter stepped out, the arguing started right away.</p>
<p>“Fuck you, Peter. <em>Fuck you!</em>” Paige said. Even from the far end of the hallway, there were tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>Peter smirked. “I didn’t say anything that wasn’t true.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know anything, you <em>asshole</em>. Fuck you! I needed this.”</p>
<p>“Ellie needs it more.”</p>
<p>“Ellie needs it because she’s a fuckup that hasn’t worked a day in her life. I’m trying to go to <em>school</em>, Peter! You make up <em>lies</em>, to sink me? You’re supposed to be my <em>twin</em>!”</p>
<p>Her voice went a little shrill at the end there.</p>
<p>“What? You thought I’d be on your side? You only need money because <em>Paul</em> had too many kids to take care of any of them. Isn’t that right, <em>Dad</em>?”</p>
<p>“I think you and Ellie have demonstrated you aren’t worth the effort,” Uncle Paul said, his voice low. He’d approached Paige, reaching out to put a hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>She stepped away, instead. She was crying, now. “I thought you’d at least play fair, Peter. Maybe you have to be loyal to Ellie because you grew up with her, but I thought you’d be <em>fair</em>, with me. We’re supposed to have a connection.”</p>
<p>“You hear about twins eating one another in the womb,” Peter said. “Maybe I got some of your brains, huh? Because that’s fucking <em>stupid</em>.”</p>
<p>Paige stared at him, incredulous. Then she slapped him, hard.</p>
<p>It was the catalyst for this entire thing to become a full-on <em>fight</em>. Not sniping one another, not lacing casual statements with words meant to cut. Shouting, Aunt Steph trying to grab Paige, and Paige ducking out of reach, running instead.</p>
<p>I was already running, myself, trying to catch up.</p>
<p>The man in scrubs, the bystander, stepped in, getting in my way. He bellowed a single word. “Stop!”</p>
<p>All fell momentarily silent. There was only the sound of Paige’s feet hitting the stairs as she made her way down.</p>
<p>I made my way through the group, and Molly did too.</p>
<p>“Molly,” the man at the door said. “She’s asking for you next.”</p>
<p>Molly and I both stopped. She looked paler than before.</p>
<p>Paige was emotionally wounded, Molly deathly afraid.</p>
<p>All of the rest of them, too, bristling, on edge.</p>
<p>“It’s my turn,” I said. “I’m Blake Thorburn. Go after Paige, Molly. I don’t think I’ll be long.”</p>
<p>“Cutting in, Blake?” Callan asked. “I think you were lying, about not wanting any of this.”</p>
<p>I gave him the finger. When I looked, Molly gave me a nod, before breaking into a run to chase Paige.</p>
<p>The man in scrubs ducked behind the door to say something, then reappeared. “She says it’s fine, Blake.”</p>
<p>I made my way into the bedroom, and the door slammed shut behind me, more because of the weight of the solid wood than any intention on my part.</p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-2424f164-fd92-d540-e263-76f9d4fe6bb7" dir="ltr"><em>Grandmother doesn’t look like someone who’s about to die. </em> The room smelled of flowers and fresh air, from the windows that opened just above the garden.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She had been propped up in a sitting position in her bed, leaning against an arrangement of pillows. She was dressed in an old fashioned nightgown that extended to her broomstick-thin wrists, her hair tied back in a tight bun. Her eyes were sharp as they studied me, and her hands were steady as they raised a teacup to her lips. Her nurse stood to her left in his scrubs, her lawyer to her right was an Indian man in an immaculate suit. Her cat, maybe the largest housecat I’d ever seen, gray and well groomed, lay with its head in her lap.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She studied me, judging me, with a cool, calculating gaze.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Well, this is refreshing,” she finally said. Her voice was clear. Not an old person’s voice. Certainly not a ninety-year old’s. “It feels like all the rest of them are dressed like they can’t wait for my funeral. Or maybe they’re too cheap to buy two outfits for the occasion.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“With all due respect,” I said, picking my words carefully, “I don’t give a flying fuck, you disgusting, evil, <em>rancid</em> cunt.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">I could see the nurse tense, though the lawyer didn’t react. The feigned politeness disappeared from my grandmother’s face. Again, she raised the teacup to her mouth to sip from it. She handed it to the nurse, who turned away very reluctantly, to prepare another cup on the trolley beneath the window.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Are you done?” she asked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m thinking both of us are very lucky you have these two men here,” I said. I put one of my feet up on the wooden chest at the foot of the bed, pointing at the trolley. “Because I’m angry enough I wouldn’t be above throwing that pitcher of water in your face.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think that’s crude,” she said. “A more civilized person would use <em>words</em> to attack me.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What words are going to matter? What am I going to say that’s going to make an impact on you? Honestly, what am I going to do that’s going to make you recognize even an <em>iota</em> of the pain you’ve caused everyone out there?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“And the pain I’ve caused <em>you</em>?” she asked. “You’re most likely right, I suppose. There’s very little that someone could say that would shake me.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You don’t deserve to die with dignity, you <em>bitch,” </em>I said. “And none of them are going to say it, because you’re <em>playing</em> them. Since I’m the only one that doesn’t give a fuck about the money, I figure I’m the only one that can come here and say it how it is. You’re scum, and you’re the <em>one</em> thing at the root of everything that’s going on out there.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">I pointed at the door. I could almost hear the shouting on the other side.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I would argue <em>they</em> are at the roots of their individual problems. I didn’t make them petty, I didn’t make them greedy,” she said. She sighed a little. “This ridiculous money business.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You took advantage of those things, making all of this one big fucked up game. Laying down the rule, that only one person gets the property and the millions from selling it. Then you say it has to be a grandchild-“</p>
<p dir="ltr">“My children are useless,” she said. She was so dismissive and casual about it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“-And then you drop the bomb that it has to be a <em>girl</em>. You broke up this family, you did it <em>strategically</em>. You set us tooth and nail against one another, and now you’re <em>enjoying</em> tearing the others down, ruining their hopes.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">She sniffed, but she smiled. I almost wanted to hit her. I wouldn’t, but I <em>wanted</em> to.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The nurse handed her the cup of tea. She smiled up at him. “Thank you, Rich.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">‘Rich’ turned my way. “I can offer you a cup as well, if you promise not to throw it at her.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Don’t offer me anything, then, thank you,” I said. I looked at my grandmother. “I don’t want <em>anything</em> she has to offer. Not tea, not the inheritance-“</p>
<p dir="ltr">“To clarify,” she said, “I’ve stressed repeatedly that it’s a <em>female</em> grandchild that will get the inheritance.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m not about to rule out the fact that you’re messing with us, <em>grandmother</em>. I could see you handing something over to Callan just to see our reactions. Not to mention the trouble I’m having with the ‘I’m dying’ bit, which you’re doing a <em>really</em> bad job of selling.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">If <em>anything</em> I’d said had an impact, it was that. I could see the faint amusement drop away from her. “Are you accusing me of being a <em>liar</em>, Master Blake?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’d never heard anyone say something archly, but she pulled it off. She even said ‘Master Blake’ like it was nothing, as though she used titles as a matter of habit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m saying there isn’t <em>anything</em> I’d put past you.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">She sighed, a faint sound, and her cat reacted to the movement. “Close to the truth, I admit, but I consider myself <em>honest</em>, if nothing else.”</p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-2424f164-fdb3-cf30-d9f5-149bda2b6d7f" dir="ltr">“Weren’t you a lawyer?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I <em>am</em> a lawyer, Master Blake, and I expect to be one until I pass on. I’m disappointed that you would make assumptions about a whole profession.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">I didn’t have a ready reply to that. I glanced at the nurse, who was shifting from foot to foot nervously. Was he uncomfortable with the friction?</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Well,” she said, “I take it you’re not going to apologize?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You first,” I told her. “It’s going to take you a while, so you should start early.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">She sipped her tea, winced at the heat, licking her thin lips with her tongue, and then leaned back against the arrangement of pillows.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You remind me of my father,” she said. “He had passion, and an interest in justice.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“He also fucked his cousin, if I remember right.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">She smiled a little. “You heard of that? Yes. That would be him.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What are you doing, Grandmother? You want to build a rapport? Form a connection, when you’ve ignored us from the beginning?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I only want to understand my grandchildren before I make my decision.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Too bad. You’re not going to figure us out in the next day or so. What you <em>should</em> do is sell the property. Let the town knock down the house, level the hill, drain the marshland and expand like they need to, make <em>them</em> happy. Split the money between your kids and grandkids, make <em>us </em>happy. You want to light a fire under everyone and get a reaction? That’s how you do it. Then, maybe just a bit, you’ll earn a measure of forgiveness.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Not an option,” she said. She stroked the cat, scratching him at the lowest part of his back, just in front of his tail. “The house stands. I’m picking the young lady who I feel can look after it.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Then pick Paige,” I said. “She’s smart, she’s hard working, she’s independent. If you’re looking for a clone of yourself to inherit the place, to look after it, I’m betting she’ll fit the bill pretty well. She’s not a bitch, but I imagine you’ll have to make <em>some</em> concessions. Besides, if anyone can squeeze a few dollars out of this stone, without breaking the rules you set, it’s her. Get bribes from people, maybe, or figure out a way to keep the house while still draining the marsh, so she can go to law school.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Paige is out of the running,” my grandmother said. “Who else?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">I stared at her. Brushing aside an argument, just like that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You’re <em>enjoying</em> this. Playing us,” I finally said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I wouldn’t recommend jumping to conclusions, Blake. Dangerous business.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Look me in the eye, then, if you’re so honest, and tell me you don’t. That you don’t get some measure of glee or satisfaction out of this.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">She looked me square in the eye.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Yet she didn’t say a word.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Thought so,” I said. “Bye, grandmother. When you do die, I hope it <em>sucks</em>.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">I turned to leave.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Blake,” she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I stopped, my hand on the doorknob. I regretted it the moment I paused.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“When you first spoke to me, you said, ‘All due respect’. Did you mean it?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">I didn’t look at her. “All due respect, you’re a festering old <em>cunt</em>? One hundred percent.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">That said, I opened the door, and I slammed it behind me with enough force that pictures rattled on the walls.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My family was there, staring.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If anyone needs me,” I said, very deliberately looking at Paige and Molly, who were standing together at the edge of the group, Molly’s arm around Paige’s shoulders. “I’m going to be outside, by the entrance.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">I made my way out of the house, down the long driveway, and settled with my back to the wall beside my bike.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I couldn’t bring myself to <em>nap</em>. A good night’s sleep in my place with the doors and windows firmly locked was hard enough. But I dozed, my eyes half open, a bit of a burden lifted from my shoulders.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:center;">■</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was well after dark when someone stepped outside to talk to me. I closed out of the puzzle game I was playing on my phone. The brightness of the screen made for a dark patch that lingered in my vision as I looked up.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Eleven-fifty at night.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“She wants us all together,” Paige said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Do you want to give her what she wants?” I asked, not moving.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’d really like some backup,” she said. All of her confidence from before was gone. “If it’s Molly that’s picked, then I can’t get the support from her, you know?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I know,” I said. I stood, stretching. I was pretty sure that I’d feel stiffness in a spot or two tomorrow. “No explanation needed. I get it.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Thanks,” she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When I turned to look, the streets were empty. Odd, that I’d felt like we were being observed. No doubt the entire town was waiting to hear how this played out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We made our way back up the driveway. I wished I had an idea of what to say, but nothing sprung to mind. Paige was too much of a stranger, in some ways. Three years was a long time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This time, everyone had gathered in the bedroom.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Paige and I joined Molly. Paige and Molly held hands.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I have to say, I’m painfully disappointed,” my grandmother said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nobody had words to reply.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Don’t worry. The feeling is mutual,” I said, because someone had to.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My aunts and uncle, along with several of the older cousins, stared at me.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Molly,” my grandmother said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“No,” Molly responded.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Until you’re twenty-five, the estate and all materials herein, my accounts, and all other pertinent materials enclosed in the documents,” my grandmother tapped the papers the lawyer held, “will be managed by Mr. Beasley and his firm. For that time period, you retain control over those assets, with free access to the full funds, modest as they are, and full access to all things relating to the property, <em>excepting</em> the ability to sell it. When you turn twenty-five, you may do with it as you wish.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I don’t want it,” Molly said, stepping forward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Molly! Don’t be rash!” Aunt Irene admonished her.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I don’t want it,” Molly said, again. She grabbed the footboard of the bed. “<em>No.</em>“</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Molly, don’t be silly.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If you don’t want any of it, then you remain free to ignore it,” my grandmother said. “Mr. Beasley? Is everything in order? Provisos, follow-up?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Everything’s signed and arranged.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">My grandmother nodded. “Rich, you’ve been wonderful. I set aside some money already, to thank you.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The nurse looked stunned. He looked at my family. “No. It’s not allowed.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I insist. Take it and give it to a favorite charity, if you must.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even then, he looked a little taken aback.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>He probably thinks my family’s going to come after him if he accepts.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>She probably plotted this. Hurting us by favoring the nurse over us.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">“If Molly doesn’t want it, I’ll take it,” Callan said. “She can sign over the rights-“</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Fuck you,” Ellie said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Granny? Why didn’t you pick me?” Little Roxanne piped up. The youngest, next to my new baby sister Ivy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I felt Paige clutch my hand tight.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You okay?” I murmured.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Grim, her mouth set in a line, eyes on the floor, Paige nodded.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Granny!” Roxanne raised her voice, more than a little shrill. “You don’t love me enough to give me <em>anything</em>?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">So that was her angle. Everyone was making a play, and the youngest of the grandchildren that could speak was making the ‘sweetheart’ play. Or the entitled brat play, depending on perspective. Misdirected, considering who my grandmother was, but that hardly mattered now.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My grandmother hadn’t reacted. I frowned.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Blake?” my dad asked. “Where are you staying tonight?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Going home,” I said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If you wanted to have a late dinner and stay over-“</p>
<p dir="ltr">“No,” I said. “I don’t want that.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Alright,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I watched as the nurse approached the bedside. He touched my grandmother’s hand.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Things went quiet very quickly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nurse Rich looked at his watch. “Two past twelve.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The arguing had distracted him. The time was off by two minutes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My grandmother and her cat were both dead.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I need to go make a phone call,” the nurse said. He strode from the room.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Silence followed, broken only by the footsteps of the nurse in the hallway, and the shuffling of papers as the lawyer put things away in a messenger bag.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Listen,” my uncle said, broaching the near-silence. “We should have a sit down, talk about the sale of the property, when the time comes, a division of the funds-“</p>
<p dir="ltr">Aunt Irene barked out a laugh. “Oh, <em>now</em> you talk about dividing up the proceeds? I seem to recall, only a few hours ago, that you told me it wouldn’t work.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">More arguing, more stupidity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Why had I told myself it would be over?</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Get out,” Molly said, her voice hard.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You heard my daughter,” Aunt Irene said. “Out. It’s her house and her say.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You too,” Molly said. “Everyone out.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Aunt Irene looked shocked at that. Uncle Paul, for his part, smirked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When I had talked to a friend about what I’d hoped to say, she’d asked me if I’d regret not saying goodbye. Now, in the aftermath of my grandmother’s passing, I felt <em>anger</em> more than regret, along with a wish that I’d spent a little more time swearing at her.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So much needless <em>stupidity</em>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“She can’t kick us out,” Uncle Paul said. “We were invited here.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I could call the authorities, Miss Thorburn,” the lawyer suggested. “For the time being, I’m at your service.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There wouldn’t be a point,” Uncle Paul said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Just go,” Molly said. “Go. You’re not going to scheme your way into any deals here. You’re not going to get some advantage or screw me out of my deal. Not tonight. I’m done talking, I’m done listening. Go, and leave me alone, and when you’ve figured out a plan of attack, run it by my lawyer first. Not me.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Slowly, the aunts and uncles, my mother and father, and the various grandchildren filtered out of the room.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Paige squeezed my hand, and then broke contact, leaving the room.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Molly,” I said. “Hey.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">She looked up at me. She looked spooked, even now. Pale, vaguely ill. Almost as if she were in shock.</p>
<p>“Why is the cat dead?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Maybe it was dead all along, and she was fucking with us.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” she said.</p>
<p>“Listen, Molly, family’s supposed to <em>support</em> each other. I figured I’d offer some support. I don’t have anywhere to be, no obligations. If you’re worried about locals giving you a hard time, whatever you need, I can stick around.”</p>
<p>“Uh huh,” Callan said, from the doorway. “Clever bastard. You don’t want the property. You want to scheme your way in with whoever <em>else</em> gets the place.”</p>
<p>“<em>Fuck off</em>, Callan,” I said.</p>
<p>But I could see the expression on Molly’s face change.</p>
<p>Doubt. Only a little doubt.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to deal with any of this. With any of <em>that</em>. Of <em>this</em>.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said. “The lawyer has my number. Ask him, get in touch, anything you need. Okay? Please?”</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>I was the last one to leave. Molly followed me down, and stood in awkward silence as I pulled on my boots.</p>
<p>“Bye,” I said. “Good seeing you.”</p>
<p>“Bye, Blake.” she said.</p>
<p>The door swung shut. My view of her and the lawyer in the background narrowing, then disappearing entirely.</p>
<p>I made my way down the path. My Uncle’s car pulled out, and I saw the younger kids in the windows, staring at me.</p>
<p>I stopped short as I saw my bike.</p>
<p>Tipped over in a way that had scraped it hard against the stone wall. Headlight and taillight broken.</p>
<p>Trying to think of whether I had seen any garages nearby, or whether they’d even be open at this hour, I started the agonizingly slow journey to downtown Jacob’s Bell.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">■</p>
<p><strong>Four months later</strong>.</p>
<p>I tossed and turned in my bed, fighting to kick the covers off. It didn’t help. I felt a pressure on top of me, pressing me down. My movements were sluggish.</p>
<p>I was supposed to be asleep, but this relentless <em>weight </em>pressing in on me from every direction had dragged me from that rest, and it hadn’t quite brought me to the point of being awake.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes, and I didn’t see my bedroom. I could feel my body in one place, sheets still hooked over one foot, my chest heaving, and I could see in another place.</p>
<p>Glances were exchanged down both lengths of the table. On one side, women and girls of varying ages, all blonde, in matching shades of green, white and blue. On the other, appearances varied. Men and women, old and young. Hair color and appearance varied, but there was little doubt they were a family.</p>
<p>“Huh,” the man at the one end of the table said. A member of the family. “I’d hoped she would slip in her old age. A shame, she made other arrangements.”</p>
<p>The blonde woman opposite him folded her hands in front of her. “That was… noteworthy in scale. Kind of her to point the way, but she was never <em>crude</em>. We’ll need to know what she did before we move on.”</p>
<p>“Agreed,” the man said. He opened a pocketwatch, glancing inside. “For now, let it be. There is enough at stake here that <em>someone</em> is bound to make a play.”</p>
<p>The blonde woman nodded. She turned her attention to the pair on either side of her, a blonde girl and a dark haired boy. reaching out for their hands. “I believe we were talking about wedding plans?”</p>
<p>I realized I’d been holding my breath, trying not to be heard. When I did breathe, it was a small gasp, not enough to bring air into my lungs.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes, trying to shut it out. When I opened them, I saw a room, everything turned to a right angle. A house, messy, with pizza boxes and garbage here and there. Two twenty-something individuals, a boy and a girl, approached, getting so close their faces filled the field of vision.</p>
<p>A lurch, and the view was righted.</p>
<p>“The metronome?”</p>
<p>“Something big just happened,” the girl said. “<em>Told</em> you. Just now, I <em>told</em> you.”</p>
<p>“You’ve been ‘telling’ me for a while now. This doesn’t mean we should do anything.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got no balls, no balls. We should investigate, and, just to be safe, we should investigate with weapons in hand.”</p>
<p>“I don’t- no, Eva. This is dangerous, and-”</p>
<p>“And what? We should ignore it all?”</p>
<p>“It’s dangerous.”</p>
<p>“So are we, little brother. So are we,” she said. She opened the ledge beneath the living room window, hefting a crossbow. She threw it at him.</p>
<p>“Fuck!” he shouted. “Eva!”</p>
<p>“It’s not loaded, dink,” she said. She picked up a revolver, then spun the chamber. “What should we bring? Silver bullets, inscribed bullets, incendiary bullets…”</p>
<p>“Cold-forged iron,” he responded, a little sullen. “Bone. Paper. Every <em>other</em> follows different rule. What looks like a goblin could be a demon, or a wraith, or a glamour. I mean, you remember those ‘vampires’ from out west.”</p>
<p>“The faerie? Sure.”</p>
<p>“You’re not getting what I’m saying. If they can fool <em>themselves </em>into thinking they’re vampires, and believe it to the point it becomes sort of <em>true</em>, sparkly skin aside, then they can fool us. <em>This</em> is what bothers me about all this. You can’t make any guarantees, you can’t slap on convenient labels. It’s why we call them <em>others</em>. You can’t plot-”</p>
<p>“We can try. And if we can murder self-deluding faerie, we can murder whatever this is.”</p>
<p>“Even if it’s human?”</p>
<p>“You’re supposed to be the smart one in this partnership. Anything that can knock the metronome over isn’t human anymore, or it won’t be for long. Let’s assume I’m going out anyways, what do I need?”</p>
<p>He sat down, leaning back, and sighed heavily. “Bring everything? Might as well bring me.”</p>
<p>“Now we’re talking,” Eva said, smiling.</p>
<p>I turned my head, and gripped the mattress. Like someone trying to come up for air, I pushed myself to an upright position. Still, I couldn’t see. When my vision started to clarify, it was a third location, outdoors this time.</p>
<p>“What the drat was that?” A girl asked. She stood in the snowy field, her checkered scarf frozen hard where the moisture of her breath had crusted it and solidified. “It felt like something<em> moved</em>.”</p>
<p>“<em>Someone</em> moved,” a young man responded. “Come on, now. You know better. Everything has a price when you’re dealing with this world, Maggie. Even answers to stupid questions.”</p>
<p>“Right. Thanks,” she said. “I’ll figure it out myself, Padraic. I hope it’s a noob. Be nice to not be the rookie on the block.”</p>
<p>“Funny thing, Maggie,” Padraic said, and when he smiled, the expression extended further than it should have. The smile too wide, the eyes too long and narrow. “When something momentous occurs, it can be the equivalent of lighting up the night sky, scattering fog and clouds to the horizons. You can see more clearly… but when you look, <em>they</em> can look back, too.”</p>
<p>Maggie went stiff. “They’re watching. And listening. <em>Darn</em> it. Now I’m going to have to do something.”</p>
<p>“I’ll give you that one for free. It was worth it, to see that expression on your face.”</p>
<p>He reached out, to touch her face, and she slapped his hand aside, hard. The small impact banished the scene.</p>
<p>There was no relief before I saw a fourth picture.</p>
<p>A girl or a woman, swaddled in winter clothes. Shouting, pointing.</p>
<p>The individual on the receiving end was a rabbit, sitting on a snow-covered rock.</p>
<p>The rabbit turned, and the girl turned to look in the same direction.</p>
<p>Bending down, she reached through the snow until she found a stone. She threw it right for the center of the ‘image’, breaking the ‘picture’.</p>
<p>Another, quickly after the last. They were starting easier and finishing easier.</p>
<p>A weathered aboriginal woman, brushing a young girl’s hair with a broad-toothed comb. It might have been an ordinary scene, except it was the dead of night.</p>
<p>She picked up a chain, then shackled the girl at the wrist. She noted the observer, then scattered the image with a wave of one hand.</p>
<p>And now a man, sitting on a throne, a tall, long-nosed, long-haired dog at his side. The room at the top of the tower was subject to strong winds, and his long hair blew as the dog’s did.</p>
<p>A still scene, quiet, the visions slowly stopping.</p>
<p>Below him, the small village sprawled. Jacob’s Bell. Except things were different. A twisted reflection of the buildings, with embellishments and decorations. Arches, steepled roofs, pointed roofs that curled and bent in zig-zags. All lit up in crimson sunset.</p>
<p>The other scenes had been at night.</p>
<p>The dog looked up. It spoke, “Johannes.”</p>
<p>“Mm,” the man in the throne said. “‘Lo, stranger. Listen, I don’t think you should believe what any of them say about me. If you need help, I can offer it.”</p>
<p>“For a price,” the dog added.</p>
<p>“For a price. Resist the urge to dismiss what you just saw, you’re in a bad enough situation as it stands. Now do yourself a favor and wake up.”</p>
<p>I did. I was sitting on the edge of my bed now, panting, gasping.</p>
<p>That feeling Molly had described, four months ago? Being surrounded? I could feel it. It was as bad as the strangeness of the visions. Or whatever those things were. Had I been drugged? Poisoned? Was I ill?</p>
<p>My hands were shaking. If they’d belonged to someone else, I would have thought they were acting, it looked so exaggerated. Impulsively, I looked over my shoulder. Nobody and nothing in my studio apartment. No hallucinations, no strangers, nothing to explain.</p>
<p>I felt like I had when I had been homeless, sleeping under the bridge, where there weren’t any lights to break up the oppressive darkness.</p>
<p><em>Resist the urge to dismiss what you just saw</em>.</p>
<p>I stood up from bed, staggering for the bathroom. I stopped, the tremor in my hands gone. Every inch the startled prey animal, where a sudden crisis leads to utter <em>stillness</em>.</p>
<p>My heartbeat felt slow, my gaze was no longer darting here and there. I was making eye contact.</p>
<p>It wasn’t my face in the mirror above the sink. Nor my body. A girl looked at me, her forehead creased in worry. She was wearing a camisole and pyjama bottoms. She looked strangely familiar.</p>
<p>I had to touch my own chest and face to verify it wasn’t <em>my</em> reflection. I was shirtless, wearing different pants. Her movements didn’t follow mine.</p>
<p>Instead, her fist struck the other side of the mirror. When she spoke, it was only a little muffled.</p>
<p>“Run,” she said. “Get to the house, <em>now</em>.”</p>
<p>“Which house? Who-”</p>
<p>“Molly’s dead,” she said. “You’re next.”</p>
<p>The conviction in her voice left me with no doubt she was telling the truth.</p>
<p>My voice was thin as I responded. “Molly’s <em>dead</em>? She was supposed to call if there was trouble.”</p>
<p>“Blake, I get it. I do. But you’re <em>next</em>, understand? Grandmother made other arrangements, and those arrangements <em>just</em> came into play. The house is in your custody now, and so are all of Grandmother’s <em>enemies</em>. Understand? She has a <em>lot</em>. The house is sanctuary, Blake. Molly died because she panicked, and she left the safe ground. Don’t make that same mistake. Move. <em>Run</em>.”</p>
<p>“But-”</p>
<p>“Run!” She hit the mirror, and it cracked from the point of impact. Pieces on my end fell, landing on the countertop and sink.</p>
<p>I ran.</p>`;

const lastPage = `<p>Wind, the purr of the engine, they blended together to make a white noise. His brain worked to make sense of it, and it created something very close to music, feeding into an almost zen-like sense of ease. Not quite <em>relaxation</em> – he felt a tiny bit of fear with every car he passed, knowing how fragile a motorcyclist could be in an incidental collision, felt pure exhilaration running through him over the simple fact that he was on the road.</p>
<p>Even with his helmet on, he could smell and taste the trees and grass. The faint aroma of gasoline and exhaust was one he very much enjoyed. When he passed wild growths of flowers on the side of the road, he could smell those, too.</p>
<p>It was fresh air. When he breathed, it felt like more oxygen got to his lungs. There was a vague high that came with it.</p>
<p>The cars around him had none of that. Some had their windows rolled down for the summer, but it was an attempt to escape the heat. When they looked out their windows, it was through just that – a window. He had unrestricted vision in every direction. His body temperature was <em>perfect</em>, the wind sapping away the heat that soaked into the dark fabric of his jacket.</p>
<p>He slowed down as traffic on the highway did. He didn’t have to, he could have navigated between the gaps without much fuss, but he figured it was sensible, especially given that he wasn’t alone. He was a little annoyed to have to do it, especially given the reason. The cars around him were slowing in attempt to take advantage of a slight rise and get a better look at a point further down the highway. It wasn’t easy, given the trees that had been planted around here, obscuring the view.</p>
<p>He could feel the fractional drop in temperature as he passed into the shade the first of the trees offered, and he smiled.</p>
<p>These trees were his landmark. He raised a hand, signalling, even as he put his lights on. A glance over his shoulder, a double check, then a change of lanes.</p>
<p>He could hear the faint shift in the sound of traffic. Another bike adjusting speed and direction, changing lanes to follow.</p>
<p>The exit took them off the highway, onto a poorly maintained side road, one that was very easy to miss. He passed a spot where poles had once been holding a sign in place, but the signboard was gone. The trees obscured the view, leaving the site a passing curiosity.</p>
<p>He signaled again, just to be sure his traveling companion wouldn’t go down the wrong road.</p>
<p>It took another ten minutes to get to their stop, going at a fairly easygoing pace on the poorly maintained road. Traffic had slowed because people were rubbernecking further ahead. The little booth had been erected at a spot with a better view. Well placed, in his estimation.</p>
<p>It was a ways until they reached the town, but it offered a distant view of the buildings and the water that lay just a bit beyond. A trail marked the way down to the side of the lake. A family was already down there, kids splashing.</p>
<p>He signaled again, well before he braked, just to be absolutely clear what he had in mind. He could smell the grease and the oil of the little stand well before he lifted up his visor. With his sinuses clear and his blood pumping, oxygen flowing through his veins, he might have said that he’d never smelled anything half as good, but he’d experienced this before.</p>
<p>“Oh my god, I could eat a whole cow,” his companion said, behind him, echoing the thought. She pulled off her helmet, and shook her head to let her cornrows loose where they’d bunched up closer to her neck.</p>
<p>“You should see the burgers here,” he said. “It’s pretty close to eating a whole cow.”</p>
<p>She put down the kickstand to her bike, then approached, throwing her arms around him. He hugged her back, and they rocked in place.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she said, squeezing him tight. “For convincing me to do this.”</p>
<p>“You’re very welcome,” he said, smiling. He shifted his grip on her until one arm encircled her lower back. He faced the surroundings with her. The water, the trees, and a distant ghost town with far too many trees blocking the view. Sating curiosity without quite <em>satisfying</em> it.</p>
<p>“What happened?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I asked, last time I was around. Rumor is that it was something about contaminated water. Dumping way back when, leeching into the town’s infrastructure. I guess it was too expensive to salvage. I don’t know the full story.”</p>
<p>“Why the trees, though?”</p>
<p>He shrugged. “Maybe they thought it would be an eyesore.”</p>
<p>“We could go back and see if there’s a road we could take to go take a look?” she suggested.</p>
<p>“Shall we grab some food, first, miss Deidre?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, without hesitation. She smiled. “Definitely.”</p>
<p>There were three other people in line before their turn came up. He let Deidre order first, then gave his own order to the man with a mullet. Burger with bacon and cheese, sweet potato fries, and fried zucchini.</p>
<p>He enjoyed the ambient chatter and people watching before the food was done. Food in hand, they left their bikes behind and walked down the path to the water, locking up their helmets and bringing their backpacks, just to keep the essentials on hand.</p>
<p>It took them a minute to get settled, sitting on a fallen tree, halfway between the water and the little roadside booth.</p>
<p>They took a minute to get straight to eating. A kid down by the water screamed. The beach itself was as much rock as sand, but the child didn’t seem to mind, running away from the waves as they approached, then chasing them as they retreated.</p>
<p>“Is this the place?” Deidre asked.</p>
<p>“The place?”</p>
<p>“You said there was one place you wanted to stop by, after Toronto but before Ottawa. Process of elimination…”</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah. This is the place.”</p>
<p>“You never said <em>why</em>. If there was a better view of the town, that’d be neat, ghost towns can be cool, but there isn’t.”</p>
<p>“It sounds dumb if I say it out loud.”</p>
<p>“Dumb?”</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t believe me,” he said.</p>
<p>She arched her fine eyebrows at him.</p>
<p>“Came through this area for the first time last year… it <em>really</em> sounds dumb if I say it out loud.”</p>
<p>“But you still plotted our entire road trip around this,” she said, before she took another bite of her pogo. “There was a detour.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“You can convince me to come with you on a spur-of-the-moment road trip, but you can’t explain this?”</p>
<p>He smiled, taking a bite so his mouth would be full and unable to respond. She smirked at him.</p>
<p>“You’re going to have to tell me sooner or later,” she said.</p>
<p>He smiled, mouth still full, and nodded.</p>
<p>“Out with it, Dominic.”</p>
<p>He finished chewing, took a deep breath, then confessed, “I came through here last summer, and again in the early fall, because I was curious. Nothing came of it in the fall, but-”</p>
<p>“I’m not following.”</p>
<p>“It’s easier if I show you. Can I get you to take my burger?”</p>
<p>Deidre did, balancing the paper container on her knee.</p>
<p>Dominic licked his lips, rolled his shoulders, clearing his throat.</p>
<p>“Stop making such a show out of it.”</p>
<p>“<em>Ahem,</em>” he said. He cupped his hands together, thumbs side-by-side, then raised his hands to his mouth.</p>
<p>He managed a chirping sound. It took some adjustment until it was clearer and sharper.</p>
<p>“That was pretty bad,” Deidre said.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“If any bird heard that, it’ll probably take it as an insult.”</p>
<p>He smirked, taking his burger back.</p>
<p>No sooner did he have the burger in his hand when a bird appeared, surprising him enough that Dominic almost dropped his lunch.</p>
<p>“Hey!” he said, a short laugh escaping his lips. The bird was circling him, going a mile a minute. “Hey! Little guy!”</p>
<p>The bird chirped in response, matching the amount of flight to the sheer amount of noise it was making.</p>
<p>“Hey, stop, stop. Settle down. Stop! Want a bit of sweet potato?”</p>
<p>The bird stopped in the next heartbeat, settling on his forearm. A sparrow, a fraction smaller than most sparrows he’d seen.</p>
<p>“I’ll take that as a yes,” he said. He pinched off a bit of sweet potato fry and gave it over.</p>
<p>The bird stopped its constant chirping just long enough to down the bit of fry, then it started chirping for more.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Deidre said. “That’s almost adorable enough to justify the lengthy detour.”</p>
<p>“Almost?” Dom asked, in the same moment the sparrow turned its full attention toward her, chirping in time with his question.</p>
<p>“Almost,” she held firm.</p>
<p>“Little guy came with me part of the way through the states last summer,” he said.</p>
<p>“What? No way.”</p>
<p>“Rode with me. Lost him a couple times, but he always caught up to me. I think he just really likes motorcycles. I think he’s someone’s pet, or he <em>was.</em>”</p>
<p>The bird chirped.</p>
<p>“Could it be a she?” Deidre asked.</p>
<p>The bird chirped again. It almost sounded indignant.</p>
<p>“No, pretty sure it’s not a she,” Dominic said.</p>
<p>“How do you know? Are you a bird expert?”</p>
<p>“Definitely not a bird expert, but-”</p>
<p>“I say she’s a girl, then,” Deidre said.</p>
<p>The sparrow took flight. Flapping violently, as it moved from Dom’s left wrist to his right shoulder. It perched there, paused, then fluttered violently, remaining in place, before stopping, feathers fluffed up.</p>
<p>It chirped at her.</p>
<p>“Or not,” she said.</p>
<p>“That’s why,” he said. “I asked the same question, back then, and I got a very similar response.”</p>
<p>The bird settled, feathers going smooth, or <em>smoother</em>. It moved back to Dom’s left wrist, before chirping for more food. It watched with rapt attention as he dipped his fried zucchini in cucumber sauce and took a bite.</p>
<p>“It’s like it knew what I was saying,” Deidre said. “Do you understand me, little guy?”</p>
<p>The bird didn’t take its attention off Dom’s fingers as he reached for another sweet potato fry. It chirped, once, as if to remind him that it was there.</p>
<p>“If you chirp twice, I’ll give you all the fries you want,” she said.</p>
<p>The bird didn’t react.</p>
<p>“It was a pet,” Dom said, with more confidence. He offered another bit of sweet potato fry. “Had to be. It responded to your tone of voice, that’s all. Probably reacts to a few key words, like the gender thing.”</p>
<p>“Right,” Deidre said. She frowned.</p>
<p>“Almost done?” he asked.</p>
<p>She nodded. “Sure, but you’re not.”</p>
<p>“Almost. Come on. He’s so funny with the motorcycle, I want to show you.”</p>
<p>He stuck the last mouthful of burger into his mouth, picked up his stuff, and led the way back up the path. The sparrow remained on his arm, staring at the paper container that still held some stray fries.</p>
<p>They reached the little shack of a restaurant, and a few heads turned at the sight of the sparrow. As they approached the bikes that were parked on the far end of the road, the sparrow took off, perching between the handlebars, then to the second bike.</p>
<p>It practically bounced in place with energy, seeming far too excited that there were two motorcycles.</p>
<p>“Okay, I have to admit, that is pretty funny.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think he’d go <em>this</em> nuts,” Dom confessed. “I don’t think his peanut brain can wrap his head around the idea of there being two motorcycles in one place.”</p>
<p>The bird flew straight for him. He had to duck to avoid it, only to realize after the fact that it would have only grazed him.</p>
<p>They both turned to see the bird disappearing off into the woods.</p>
<p>“Huh,” Dom said.</p>
<p>“What was that you said about tone of voice? I think you hurt his feelings.”</p>
<p>“Ha ha,” he said, deadpan.</p>
<p>“Seriously though, the bird was funny. Thanks for showing me.”</p>
<p>“Not a problem,” Dominic said, but his attention was on the trees, his thoughts elsewhere.</p>
<p>“Would have been fun to have it follow along, but I guess it was a fluke thing, last year?”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” he said, his attention still elsewhere.</p>
<p>Where did the bird go?</p>
<p>“Hey, Deids,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Watch my stuff?”</p>
<p>“Bathroom break?”</p>
<p>“Nah, no,” he said. Almost without taking his eyes off the trees, he pulled off his jacket and put it with his backpack on the seat of his bike, then headed down the path. Being still, without the benefit of the wind and the motion of the bike, he’d accumulated a bit of sweat.</p>
<p>He’d tracked the direction the bird had gone. That meant veering off to the right, into thicker trees. He used his hands and arms to brush at the branches.</p>
<p>The way wasn’t easy. He made it far enough into the woods that he began to have doubts, to suspect that he’d been wrong.</p>
<p>But the bird had flown with <em>purpose</em>, hadn’t it?</p>
<p>The thick canopy made the way surprisingly dark. The light that filtered through did so in beams and as an ambient glow, lighting up the dust and pollen in the air.</p>
<p>He heard a laugh. A girl’s.</p>
<p>He stopped, and he approached with a little more care.</p>
<p>A murmur, the girl’s voice, words inaudible.</p>
<p>A chirp. The sparrow.</p>
<p>He stopped.</p>
<p>She was sitting by the water, back to a tree. He couldn’t be sure if it was an old woman or a girl with platinum blond hair bleached whiter by the sun, but the voice, the laugh, and the fit of the seafoam colored sweatshirt she wore suggested the latter.</p>
<p>The sparrow was perched on her finger, busy chirping.</p>
<p>If he’d waited any longer, Dominic might have felt like he was doing something wrong.</p>
<p>“Miss!” he called out.</p>
<p>The girl froze.</p>
<p>“Are you the sparrow trainer? I was wanting to ask. Last summer, I-”</p>
<p>There was a flutter, a flap. Not the sparrow that had perched on her finger. If it weren’t for the branches right behind him, Dom might have fallen over backward.</p>
<p>As it was, he caught himself, freezing with a sparrow just inches from his face, perched on his shoulder.</p>
<p>The smaller sparrow arrived a moment later, flying his way. He put out a hand, and it settled on his knuckles.</p>
<p>The girl was gone. Small waves lapped up around where she’d been.</p>
<p>“Uh,” he said.</p>
<p>His heart was pounding, and he couldn’t put words to why. It wasn’t just the fact that the larger of the two birds had nearly flown into his face.</p>
<p>The little sparrow bounced with excitement. The larger one remained where it was, ruffling its feathers momentarily, almost seeming to ignore Dom altogether. Its attention was on the trees.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m going back to my bike. You can come if you want,” he said.</p>
<p>The sparrows didn’t leave. Dom turned to go back to the path and Deidre, then paused, glancing back.</p>
<p>No sign.</p>
<p>The birds were patient as he forged his way past the branches and everything in his way, the small one flying off and away when he accidentally almost knocked it off with a stray branch.</p>
<p>Back into the daylight. The smaller sparrow perched on him again as he headed up to the food shack and Deidre.</p>
<p>“<em>There</em> you are,” she said. He raised her eyebrows. “And you brought friends.”</p>
<p>“I did,” he said.</p>
<p>Both sparrows took off. Each one settled on a different bike. The larger on his bike, the smaller on Deidre’s.</p>
<p>“There’s <em>two</em> trained sparrows?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“What do you call them?”</p>
<p>He shrugged. “I don’t.”</p>
<p>“You could call the big one Ugly,” she said. She turned her head at a sound, then shooed the smaller of the two sparrows. “No! Do not peck my motorcycle! No!”</p>
<p>It evaded her sweeping hands and settled back in the same place.</p>
<p>Dom looked at the larger sparrow that had perched on his bike. Unlike the small one, it seemed to be more focused on the surroundings than on <em>him</em>, or even the bike. It had feathers sticking up here and there, and it was a little <em>dirtier</em>. A small bit of branch was stuck in the plumage at its front. It looked like a sparrow that a cat had hacked up and left on the forest floor. Still, it had looked very similar last summer, too.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to call it Ugly,” Dom said, not taking his eyes off the little creature. “It saved my life. Maybe.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I know it sounds dumb. But I was riding through the states, and there was this moment where I was overtaking, and I had that feeling. You probably know the feeling I’m thinking about. Something being wrong. Small voice in my head said ‘no’. But I went ahead, ignored it, and the car I was overtaking started merging into my lane. Totally blind to the fact that I was there.”</p>
<p>“The bird saved you?”</p>
<p>“Getting to that. The speed I was going, where the car was, the incoming traffic, I had that <em>moment</em> where I realized it was all going to go in a bad way, no matter what happened. Then, bam. Bird that was riding with just flies off, slams into the side window of the car. Scares the shit out of the driver, they correct, and I don’t die.”</p>
<p>Deidre looked at the bird.</p>
<p>“They rode with me all the way to Wisconsin. Disappeared. When I was on my return trip, they found me. Rode with me back here. They weren’t around in the fall, when I checked in. In retrospect, I’m not sure they weren’t acting as someone <em>else’s</em>…”</p>
<p>He trailed off, looking at the bird, and saw it staring at him. Very still. As quiet as the smaller one was animated. Deidre hadn’t said anything, so he elaborated, “…I was going to say guardian angels, but…”</p>
<p>“But?”</p>
<p>He thought of the white haired girl he’d glimpsed, the way she’d disappeared.</p>
<p>The ‘guardian angel’ thing had been an amusing thought before. Now it felt a little less like an idle thought.</p>
<p>He couldn’t put words to that feeling. Instead, he said, “I really like the idea of them being along for our road trip. Especially while you’re with.”</p>
<p>She smiled, approaching to grab him by the shirt front, and gave him a peck on the lips. “Sure.”</p>
<p>The little one peeped.</p>
<p>“If they’re coming,” she said. “I’m happy if they are, but we can’t get your hopes up.”</p>
<p>“I think they are,” he said. “Are you two coming with? Deidre and I are heading to Labrador.”</p>
<p>The little one peeped again, bouncing on the spot. The big one only turned, facing forward.</p>
<p>Dominic smiled.</p>
<p>“How about we loop back, see if we can’t take the other road and head down to explore the little ghost town, satisfy your curiosity?” he asked her. “Then we can head on our way.”</p>
<p>“Sure!”</p>
<p>They began to steer the bikes around. It was only a short trip back to a branch in the road. The birds remained at the front of the bikes.</p>
<p>A chain stretched across the side road, but it wasn’t impossible to duck under.</p>
<p>The moment they had the bikes pointed at the road in question, however, the birds took off, first the large one, then the small one.</p>
<p>Both perched on branches, just a short distance away.</p>
<p>Dominic blinked.</p>
<p>“Come on,” he said.</p>
<p>The birds didn’t move.</p>
<p>“Just visiting the town. We can pass right through and pop out the other side, head to Ottawa, then Montreal, maybe.”</p>
<p>The little one peeped.</p>
<p>Still sitting astride his motorcycle, he raised his hands, and tried the bird call.</p>
<p>He got two blank stares instead.</p>
<p>“Won’t?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I’ll remind you that you’re talking to birds,” Deidre pointed out.</p>
<p>He leaned forward, elbows and arms draped over the handlebars of his motorcycle. “Come <em>onnn</em>.”</p>
<p>The birds didn’t budge.</p>
<p>“Maybe they <em>can’t?</em>” Deidre asked.</p>
<p>“Can’t?”</p>
<p>“It’s like… you hear about animals reacting before an earthquake hits. You said it was groundwater contamination. Maybe they sense something wrong down that way, so they’ll instinctively refuse.”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” Dom conceded. “Poisons in the air?”</p>
<p>Deidre offered a shrug. She had very nice shrugs.</p>
<p>“How committed are you to going this way?”</p>
<p>“Not very,” she said. “If I’m being totally honest, I had a bad feeling, like the one you described. Nothing I can reason or explain, but-”</p>
<p>“But a bad feeling,” he said. He sat up straighter. “Good enough. On to the highway, head to and through Ottawa, find some spot between there and Montreal to settle down for the night?”</p>
<p>Deidre smiled. “Sounds good.”</p>
<p>“What about you two?” he asked.</p>
<p>There was no response.</p>
<p>“Right,” he said.</p>
<p>But as he turned the bike around to go back toward the little shack and the highway beyond, there was a flutter.</p>
<p>The birds settled in, the large one perched on his headlight.</p>
<p>He paused. The girl with white hair stuck in his mind.</p>
<p>“Two ways we can go,” Dominic said, “Take the main highway, or we can go by the <em>water</em>.”</p>
<p>No sooner was the word <em>water</em> out of his mouth than the little one started to bounce in place.</p>
<p>Even the large one looked at him, which was about as much attention as it had given him in the entire road trip last summer.</p>
<p>Deidre laughed, and it was a good sound. “I don’t think I get a say.”</p>
<p>“By the water it is,” Dom said.</p>
<p>Dominic led the way, easing in, gently ramping up the speed, one eye on the sparrow.</p>
<p>It managed a good enough grip, though the vibrations of the engine had to be rattling its brain in its skull.</p>
<p>Tough little critter didn’t seem to mind.</p>
<p>He picked up speed, until he’d matched pace with traffic on the highway. He merged into traffic, glancing back to make sure Deids and the little guy were with him.</p>
<p>They passed the trees that seemed to surround the little ghost town. It didn’t take long to pass it outright.</p>
<p>Small as it was, the sparrow couldn’t hold on forever. Shortly after the town was left behind, there was a bump in the road, and it came loose, disappearing off to the side.</p>
<p>Dominic tried not to worry, but it was hard.</p>
<p>But, sure enough, just as it had been last year, the bird reappeared. It wasn’t faster than the bike, but the highway curved gently, and the bird could fly in a straight line, meeting him further ahead, then continuing on, to meet him at the next bend.</p>
<p>It would fall behind eventually, he knew, but it would always catch up somehow. If it got tired, it would take advantage of his stopping for gas or food to catch a ride, somewhere where the wind wouldn’t throw it loose.</p>
<p>In Dominic’s peripheral vision, the sparrow was joined by its smaller companion, and the two drifted out in the general direction of the lake.</p>
<p>The way got clearer as they got further from Toronto and the annoyance of the slower traffic around the ghost town. He smiled, accelerating, content to be leaving it all behind.</p>`;

const bonds1_2 = `<p>I was dressed and heading out the door in less than a minute, a plain black toque pulled over my hair. I had to fumble around for a moment to manage the coat I was getting on, the backpack I’d stuffed with spare shirts, sweaters and underwear, and the keys I needed to lock my apartment.</p>
<p>I reached the stairwell and took the stairs three at a time, descending each half-flight of stairs in two steps.</p>
<p>Mirror people, visions of talking dogs and stretched faces, vampire hunters or witch hunters or whatever they were. It was unbelievable, impossible to wrap my head around. So I didn’t believe it, didn’t try to understand it. I didn’t <em>disbelieve</em> it either. I was processing it, really, filing it all away for future consideration.</p>
<p>It was stupid, maybe, crazy, to dismiss it. By all right, my worldview should have been turned upside down by this.</p>
<p>Except other things were taking a kind of priority, demanding consideration, turning my life upside down.</p>
<p>Molly was dead. I’d heard it, and I believed it. Taken alone, the statement might have meant little, but I’d had an ominous feeling since leaving the inheritance gathering. Right here, right now, I felt like it <em>fit</em>. I didn’t want it to, but it fit.</p>
<p>The gathering had been the first time I had seen Molly since we were kids. I could barely guess what she was like now, as a near-adult.</p>
<p>What she <em>had</em> been like, as an almost adult. I felt a twist of worry, and a fair bit of anger. Why hadn’t she <em>called</em> me?</p>
<p>For all the impact my family had had on my life, there were very few people I had ever had a connection with. I had never been mistreated, exactly, but there hadn’t been a lot of love to go around either. Molly and Paige had been the ones to greet me with smiles on their faces, to hug me instead of offering an informal handshake. We’d played together, laughed, and bridged the gap between being family to being friends.</p>
<p>When I thought of Molly, I thought of the child she had been ten years ago, not the young woman I’d briefly met at the end of the summer. When I reminded myself that she could well be dead, I felt like I’d lost something from a relatively small pool of happy family memories.</p>
<p>I reached the bottom of the stairwell, and as I hurried down the length of the hallway, past the elevators that would have taken too long to use, I was still trying to frame it all in my head.</p>
<p>Molly’s death wouldn’t have been random. There had been a reason, and that reason had driven my grandmother to do what she’d done. All of the fallout from that, the divide in the family, the animosity that had driven me from home to a cold, hostile, unfriendly world, shared that same root <em>cause</em>. It was hard to pin how much of my haste was self preservation and how much was my desire to get answers.</p>
<p>Molly was dead. I believed it. I could figure it out, I could get the world in alignment again, so things made <em>sense</em>.</p>
<p>If it was even possible for things to make sense with talking animals and twisted mirror-cities.</p>
<p>I stopped at the doors at the end of the lobby, paused, then knocked.</p>
<p>It took time for the door to open. I worked on getting my scarf on and making sure my backpack was buckled shut, keys stowed away.</p>
<p>The door opened, and my bear of a landlord stood in the way, leveling a stare at me. He wore an undershirt that strained across his stomach, and pyjama pants with pink and magenta stripes, with thick-frame glasses and thick caterpillar eyebrows on an otherwise hairless, unadorned head.</p>
<p>“Blake? It’s five in the morning.” He had a trace of a Quebecois accent.</p>
<p>“Joel. It’s an emergency. I need your car.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?” He switched from annoyance to concern in an instant. “Need a ride?”</p>
<p>“Out of town emergency. I’ve got to steal your car for a bit. Please.”</p>
<p>“How long?” he asked, turning away from the door.</p>
<p>I could see the mirror that was opposite the front door, wide and tall, with an ostentatious frame. The mirror girl was on the other side, staring at me.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I said.</p>
<p>He turned back to me, holding keys firmly in his fist. His bulk blocked my view of the girl in the mirror. “Work with me here, Blake. I need <em>something, </em>if I’m loaning you my car<em>.</em>”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I repeated myself. “But I’ve got to go, I can’t ride my bike in this weather, and there isn’t any other way to get there. I’m stuck, and I don’t know how to handle this.”</p>
<p>“Slow down. What happened?”</p>
<p>“I think my cousin died. It’s two hours away, so if you needed the car, I could bring it back in a pinch, figure a way to get back, or-”</p>
<p>“Shhh,” he interrupted me. I made myself stop. Very calm, soothing, he said, “It’s <em>fine</em>. I’m so sorry about your cousin, baby.”</p>
<p>I shrugged, breaking eye contact. I wasn’t good with people being kind to me. Not without some warning. “I’m not sure it’s true. It doesn’t make sense.”</p>
<p>“Go, do what you need to do,” he said. He extended his hand, keys dangling from the ring that was now around his middle finger.</p>
<p>I took the keys, then fumbled with my own. I held my bike key for a moment, weighing it in my hand, then handed it over.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to,” Joel said.</p>
<p>“I do,” I said. “For me, as much as for you. I’m- it’ll make sure I don’t forget your car back to you soon, because I’ll miss it, and that’ll remind me.”</p>
<p>He nodded, then took my key. “I got you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Joel,” I said.</p>
<p>“You have my number, if you need it.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “You’re a good friend.”</p>
<p>“Speaking of… weren’t you going to set things up for Goosh’s show?”</p>
<p>I winced. My job. “I didn’t think. I don’t- <em>shit.</em>”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I’ll explain to the others. We’ll use the Sisters.”</p>
<p>“Goosh told me she wanted to kill them, the last time she hired them.”</p>
<p>“She’ll find a way to cope, after I explain what’s up. Don’t worry. You focus on what you need to, and trust us to have your back. Okay?”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“There’s a hug here if you want or need it.”</p>
<p>I hesitated, but he knew that I would.</p>
<p>The lights went out. We were plunged into darkness, the hallway and lobby lit only by the moonlight that reflected off the snow.</p>
<p>I could see movement behind Joel. The girl in the mirror, moving her arms.</p>
<p>“Power outage?” he asked, stepping further into the hallway to look around.</p>
<p>“Looks like,” I said. My eyes were on the mirror. If he turned around, would he see her?</p>
<p>“I should go make sure everything’s okay,” he said. “Might be the breaker.”</p>
<p>The girl in the mirror raised her arms. Forearms crossed against one another, forming an ‘x’.</p>
<p>“Do me another huge favor?” I asked.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Joel replied.</p>
<p>When he looked at me, I had trouble meeting his eyes. I wasn’t used to omitting the truth when dealing with friends. “Go back to bed. Sleep. I’ve got a bad feeling, and I’m not sure if it’s just because I feel like you’ll never get back to bed if you go now or if it’s something else. But I’ve got to go, and I feel like I’d be a lot happier if I knew you were in bed, instead of wandering around a dark building alone.”</p>
<p>“Gut feeling?” he asked. “That’s not like you.”</p>
<p>“Gut feeling,” I said. “Instincts.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he said. “Sure. For your instincts, I’ll be lazy this morning. Until I get the first irate phone call.”</p>
<p>I nodded. Then I accepted his offer for a hug, reaching out. He folded his arms around me, warm.</p>
<p>The girl in the mirror looked nervous, pacing back and forth, occasionally peering around, as if she could get a different perspective. A moment later, she strode out of view, stepping beyond the boundaries of the frame.</p>
<p>I took that as my cue to go. As I broke the hug, Joel rubbed his hand over the toque and then gave me a little push, an urging to get going.</p>
<p>I got going.</p>
<p>His car was in the garage, a few steps away, through a heavy door. I hit the button to raise the big garage door, and watched as the wall of snow that the wind had driven against the door tipped over, breaking into chunks as it hit the damp pavement.</p>
<p>I unlocked Joel’s Corolla, a car old enough that the only way to open the door was to actually put the key in the lock, and then stopped.</p>
<p>I moved the rear-view mirror until I had a view of the girl in the back seat.</p>
<p>“Answers,” I said.</p>
<p>“Go, and I’ll give you answers,” she responded. She sounded even fainter and more muffled than before. “You think the lights went out by coincidence?”</p>
<p>If I went, I’d get answers from her. I’d get answers from the house, about Molly…</p>
<p>Answers were good. I took a second to familiarize myself with both the car and with cars in general, where things were and how to operate the things.</p>
<p>In moments, both me and the car were traveling down the near-empty streets.</p>
<p>“Okay,” she said.</p>
<p>“Your name?”</p>
<p>“Rose.”</p>
<p>“Rose… who are you supposed to be? My grandmother?”</p>
<p>“No. I think I’m you. Your- our parents named me after her.”</p>
<p>I was silent, taking that in.</p>
<p>“I know I’m supposed to say something witty here, make a quip, but I’m barely thinking straight,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m you, with one fundamental difference,” Rose elaborated. “I’m a girl. I think grandmother is trying to game the system somehow. A failsafe or trap or <em>something</em>, that kicks in when Molly dies and the inheritance turns over.”</p>
<p>The reminder of Molly’s death was a slap in the face. “How did you know, that Molly’s dead?”</p>
<p>“That’s complicated.”</p>
<p>“Two hour drive, Rose. We have time for a complicated explanation.”</p>
<p>“Not the time consuming kind of complicated. This stuff was <em>explained</em> to me. I crashed into existence, with only a few places I could go. I’ve got a lifetime of memories, but I get that I’m a fake. If I were real, I wouldn’t be sitting here, surrounded by an awful lot of darkness. I’d have a proper <em>heartbeat</em>, instead of this slow motion thump every few seconds, staying the same even when I’m freaked out. I see a bit of a glimmer of an outline here or there, where the light’s really strong on your end. But there aren’t many places I can go, Blake. Patches of light, where light passes through the mirrors. Only the mirrors in the house, and the mirrors around <em>you </em>count.”</p>
<p>I glanced up at the rear view mirror. She looked upset, her knees drawn up to her chin, feet on the seat in front of her. Was she cold, sitting there in pyjama pants and a camisole, barefoot in a car where my breath fogged up? Or were the lack of breath and response to the temperature the same as her heartbeat? Something false or simplified?</p>
<p>I couldn’t look at her for too long, given the need to focus on the road. I pulled onto the highway, double and then triple checking there weren’t any cars coming.</p>
<p>Rose kept talking. “The lawyer, Beasley, he was cleaning up. Picking up books and stuff that Molly left lying around. When I asked what was going on, he said you were next in line, for custody of the house. After you, it’s Kathy, then Ellie, then Roxanne, then Ivy, then Paige.”</p>
<p>“Paige is last?” I asked. Okay, I got that maybe Kathryn would fit. She was a mom, a professional. A serious personality. Maybe a bit cutthroat, but I could get that.</p>
<p>“Paige is last,” she said.</p>
<p>Placing the two and twelve year old in the list before <em>Paige</em>? Placing <em>me</em> in the running?</p>
<p>“Doesn’t make sense,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yeah. I don’t know. I didn’t stay for explanations. Depending on how things went, he said, we could run down that list <em>really</em> quickly. He said it depends on how fast people can get to the house, and how fast they can get to grips with all this. He said I should find you, and I found you.”</p>
<p>Far less in the way of answers than I’d hoped for.</p>
<p>I drove in silence for a few minutes.</p>
<p>The answers only raised more questions. How did Paige fit into this? How did <em>I</em> fit into it? Most confusing of all… Rose.</p>
<p>“What I’m wondering is… you,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m wondering about me too,” she said. “Trust me, if you’re wondering if I’m suspicious, if there’s a catch here, I’m wondering too.”</p>
<p>“How do your memories line up? Molly got picked, but… you were at the house?”</p>
<p>“I was home, with mom and dad. They’re mad, you know, obviously, because I didn’t get Hillsglade House, and they thought it was as close to a given as you could get. Mad at me, especially. I was in bed, mostly asleep, and then I was at the house. I remember everything about my life, but I don’t feel like I experienced any of it. You know?”</p>
<p>“Not really,” I said. I watched the tail lights of a truck ahead of me disappearing into the snowy fog, further down the arrow-straight highway. I was driving slower, because I didn’t have much winter driving experience, and I didn’t want to total Joel’s car. Noting a silence that had followed my response, I tried to keep the discussion going. “You still live with mom and dad?”</p>
<p>“While I’m going to school,” she said.</p>
<p>“You didn’t leave?”</p>
<p>“No. Why? When did you move out?”</p>
<p><em>Move out</em>. She didn’t know about me leaving home.</p>
<p>“A bit ago,” I said, noncommittal. No use volunteering unnecessary information.</p>
<p><em>What’s the magic loophole</em>?</p>
<p>If Rose was a failsafe, who or what was it trying to work around? If it was a trap, then who was the supposed victim? Was there an enemy? Or was it a trap aimed at <em>me</em>?</p>
<p>Was there a chance this was all a lie?</p>
<p>I could wonder if I was losing my mind, but… I felt lucid.</p>
<p>While that wasn’t a guarantee I was sane, I knew, but I felt lucid, and it was hard to sell myself the idea that I was insane, if there weren’t any clear symptoms.</p>
<p>I was seeing things, but having two points of reference would have made it a lot easier, giving me a kind of perspective on it all.</p>
<p>My hands were clutching the wheel so hard that it was painful. I had to consciously will myself to relax.</p>
<p>“Rose, talk to me,” I said. “There isn’t nearly enough information to piece things together, and I’m not going to make it through this drive if I’ve only got my own worries and paranoia to fill the time.”</p>
<p>“What do you want me to say?”</p>
<p>“You seemed to know <em>something</em> was up, with the power going out.”</p>
<p>“There was a presence. Like… almost as if there was a patch of something lighter in the darkness, or a sound I could barely hear, or a movement of the air, here, where the air doesn’t move at all. <em>Something</em> was there.”</p>
<p><em>Something</em>.</p>
<p>“This isn’t helping the paranoia,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m not any happier,” she said. “If something chases us, <em>you</em> can run. Where can I run? There isn’t much room, on this side.”</p>
<p>“Yet you broke the mirror. Speaking of, how did you know you could break it?”</p>
<p>“I <em>didn’t</em>. That was an accident, and I wish I hadn’t done it. It <em>hurt</em>, and I feel drained, and I feel tired. It <em>took</em> something out of me, doing that, and I’m not sure I have that much to give.”</p>
<p>“Rose, are you understanding what I’m getting at? There’s a few things here that aren’t making sense. Crazy hallucinations or whatever else.”</p>
<p>“You had the visions too?”</p>
<p>“<em>Rose,</em>” I said, speaking a little firmer, to keep her on track. “The more time I have to think about all this, the less I feel like I can trust you. How did you know how to get from the light at the house to <em>me</em>? Considering that this all supposedly started less than an hour ago, you’re picking it up pretty damn fast.”</p>
<p>“It’s not- no. Blake, the lawyer <em>told</em> me to go. He pointed in a direction, and told me to take a leap of faith if I wanted to help you. I did what he said, and now I’m here. I’m jumping from mirror to mirror, and I’m worried I’m going to jump and I’ll <em>miss</em>, and I’m not sure what happens when I do.”</p>
<p>“You left out that part,” I said. “About him telling you how to jump. That’s context I could have used.”</p>
<p>“I’m <em>not</em> your enemy, here,” she said, and her voice was harder, angrier.</p>
<p>If I was planning to press the subject, the plan had to go on hold.</p>
<p>I saw a figure standing in the middle of the highway, in the distance.</p>
<p>I slowed the car.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Rose asked.</p>
<p>It was a person, tall, dressed in a long cloak or layered garment of some sort. Right in the middle of the road. The cloth had been white to begin with, it looked like, but it was badly stained. He –<em>or she</em>– wore a mask or a helmet shaped like an overlarge bird’s skull, with a pair of antlers.</p>
<p>I didn’t have a lot of time to take it in. Even though I was driving slowly, even though I was slowing down, I was closing the distance. I didn’t want to <em>stop</em>, but…</p>
<p>I turned to go around, giving the white thing as much clearance as I could. It stayed where it was, standing in place. There were no other cars on the highway, coming or going. Woods on one side, field on the other. Not that I could see all that far. Snow flurries made vision past a point a little difficult.</p>
<p>“I can feel it,” Rose said. When I glanced up, she was looking over one shoulder. “I can see it, almost, standing between the patches of light.”</p>
<p>We flew past it. I could see its head turn to follow us. The drape it wore had no sleeves. It wore hides, almost white, except where the slush and dirt had marred it.</p>
<p>I had to move the rearview mirror to get a better view of it as we left it behind.</p>
<p>A sign of things to come? A harbinger?</p>
<p>My heart was pounding.</p>
<p>“What <em>was</em> that?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Something wearing a bird skull mask and tanned skins.”</p>
<p>“What are we going to do?” she asked, with a note of panic in her voice.</p>
<p><em>What am I going to do, you mean</em>, I thought. <em>You’re on the other side of a mirror</em>.</p>
<p>“It’s gone,” I said.</p>
<p>“What? No. No it isn’t,” she answered. Panic was now highlighted by confusion, incredulity. “It’s <em>close</em>.”</p>
<p>I looked back, but the figure was nearly impossible to make out against the backdrop of falling snow.</p>
<p>“We left it behind,” I said, firmer.</p>
<p>“You got close, and it latched on,” Rose said. “Believe me on this.”</p>
<p>Again, I turned around, trying to see where it might have done so. Nothing outside the windows, nothing in the mirrors.</p>
<p>When I returned my attention to the road, my eyes darting up to the mirror, she insisted, “It <em>did</em>. It still feels like it’s <em>here</em>.”</p>
<p>I set my jaw. What was I supposed to do if it was? If it could reach out and grab the car with some invisible hand, or if there was something screwed up going on, then what options did I really have?</p>
<p>I didn’t have weapons. I didn’t have much of anything. Even information was scarce. How was I supposed to label the bird skull thing?</p>
<p>It was only when I settled down, returning my attention to the drive ahead of me, that I saw the trouble.</p>
<p>The fuel gauge was dropping steadily.</p>
<p>It had been three quarters of the way full when I’d started driving. Now it was at the twenty percent mark.</p>
<p>The orange needle dropped faster with every passing second.</p>
<p>It had latched on, but not <em>physically</em>. Something else.</p>
<p>“The car’s dying,” I said.</p>
<p>“Gas station?” Rose asked.</p>
<p>“There’s a rest stop,” I said. “Restaurants, gas, bathrooms, stores. I think that’s what the sign said it was two kilometers away. Might be a bit further.”</p>
<p><em>Ten percent.</em></p>
<p>“Can you make it?”</p>
<p><em>Eight percent.</em></p>
<p>“No,” I said. “Not with the car.”</p>
<p>I watched as the needle stopped descending. No further to go.</p>
<p>The car shuddered, and the gas pedal quit on me. I saw the lights on the dash and the radio dim, then go out entirely.</p>
<p>I switched to neutral, hoping to coast, but there was nothing. I pulled over, instead. I tried to activate the hazard lights. No luck.</p>
<p>When I got my cell phone, a cheap non-smart phone, I found it dark.</p>
<p>I saw one car zip by on the other side of the divider. I hopped out, flailing my arms, but it was useless. Too little, too late.</p>
<p>“Guess I’m walking,” I said. I drummed the steering wheel for a second, thinking. In front and behind me, the snow looked a pale blue in the moonlight, broken up by the dark shapes of trees. Here and there, the street lights tinted things orange. The road was a stripe of black in the gloom.</p>
<p>“Bring a mirror,” Rose said. “Please.”</p>
<p>I looked around. Nothing. Joel kept a neat car. Aside from an abundance of paperwork in the drive compartment, and between the front and passenger seats, it was tidy, and tidy meant it was easy to see there wasn’t anything like that nearby.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Joel,” I said. I reached up to grab the rear view mirror. There were tabs I needed to depress. I had to pull off my gloves to get a good grip. I fumbled with it some more.</p>
<p>“Blake,” Rose said. “Blake!”</p>
<p>I moved the mirror to look at her, and saw her pointing.</p>
<p>I turned.</p>
<p>Behind us, beyond a point where the snow obscured the road, I saw the dim orange of the street light flicker, then die, swallowed up by the swirl of white.</p>
<p>“No time to get the mirror, Rose,” I said. I made sure I had the other essentials. Hat, scarf, gloves, backpack, coat…</p>
<p>“Break it off?”</p>
<p>I reached up and pulled. It didn’t budge. I hit it with the side of my arm, with no more effect.</p>
<p>“I can’t,” I said.</p>
<p>“You <em>cannot</em> leave me here!” There was a note of hysteria in her voice.</p>
<p>I pulled out my cell phone. An older model I could slide open to get at the keyboard. The screen was scuffed badly from sitting in my pockets alongside change and my keys. “Does this work? There’s a reflection in the screen.”</p>
<p>“No,” she said. “Barely anything coming through”</p>
<p>I hesitated, then used my bag, looping the strap around the mirror. I hauled down with almost all of my weight.</p>
<p>It snapped off.</p>
<p>“Good,” I said. “With me?”</p>
<p>“With you,” she said.</p>
<p>I hopped out of the car, heading into the back seat to search for anything I could use. There were a pair of skates, a bag laid out flat with a suit inside, clearly Joel’s. When I lifted up the panel at the back of the car, I found the spare tire and a slot for the tire iron. I grabbed the iron.</p>
<p>I left the car behind, pausing one second to lock it, and then got moving. I maintained a speed that was faster than an ordinary walk, not quite a jog. Busy walking, I jammed the mirror in the front pocket of my coat, so one end stuck out. My hands went in my pockets, one end of the tire iron finding the inside pocket, the length resting against my forearm.  I hunched over to help shield my face with the collar of my coat, preparing. Conserving strength, conserving heat.</p>
<p>I was a fast walker. Two kilometers… that was about twenty minutes?</p>
<p>I didn’t want to go so fast that I’d have to stop before I got to shelter. So long as I kept moving, I was warm. When I stopped, the cold would set in. Twenty minutes of brisk walking.</p>
<p>When I finally broke and glanced back, I saw there were less lights than before. The thing was following me. I couldn’t be sure of the speed it was moving, given how it was out of sight. I couldn’t tell, either, if it was catching up.</p>
<p>“Talk to me, Rose,” I mumbled, past my scarf and the collar of my coat. “Can you feel it getting closer?”</p>
<p>There was no reply. I drew my free hand from the pocket and pulled the mirror free.</p>
<p>Fat, wet flakes of snow had clustered against the surface. With one hand, I rubbed it against my thigh.</p>
<p>Beads of water still obscured the surface.</p>
<p>“Rose?” I tried.</p>
<p>There was no response. Already, the mirror was fogging up from the momentary warmth and the moisture.</p>
<p>If the cell phone hadn’t worked because it was scuffed, then this might be having the same problems. I needed a <em>clear</em> reflection, apparently.</p>
<p>I picked up the pace a little. I placed the mirror inside my coat, in the slot where I was supposed to stick my phone. Closer to my body, warmer, where my shirt and the pocket could maybe dry off the moisture. The ‘arm’ of the mirror rubbed against my chest as I marched.</p>
<p>The snow that had piled up at the edge of the road, before the ditch that divided the highway from the nearby fields meant I had to walk out on the road itself. Walking through the snow would slow me down, and I needed speed. I was in a dangerous position, ready to be clipped by a car in the cruising lane.</p>
<p>My heart thudded in my chest. A short walk, I reassured myself.</p>
<p>I looked back, to look for cars, and to see the thing’s progress.</p>
<p>It was close enough for me to make it out. It was making long, powerful strides, at a speed I couldn’t have maintained without risking collapse. The hides it wore flew out to the side as the legs moved, but I couldn’t make out the legs themselves.</p>
<p>I pushed myself a fraction faster, but I knew it wasn’t quite enough to make a difference.</p>
<p>Still, there were no cars on the road. I needed <em>one</em> passerby. One person to stop and offer me a lift.</p>
<p>Except I couldn’t be sure it would work. They might find themselves running out of gas in some inexplicable manner. Then the good Samaritan would be caught up in this.</p>
<p>I glanced back. It was closer, closing the distance with every step.</p>
<p>The wind picked up, and I had to close my eyes in the face of the headwind. There were tears in my eyes when I opened them. Totally the wind. My army surplus boots squeaked against the soft snow and crunched against the harder snow as I marched.</p>
<p>I heard a fluttering noise. Turning to look, I saw that one of the flaps of hide were whipping around in the wind. The footsteps, by contrast, were nearly silent. No squeaks, no crunches, no cracks of ice being broken or scuffs of salt and pavement underfoot.</p>
<p>It was close enough for me to hear.</p>
<p>Better now than never. I turned around, drawing out the tire iron.</p>
<p>“Fine!” I roared the words against the wind. I drew the tire iron from my pocket, gripping it with gloved hands. I could feel how cold the metal was. “You want me!?”</p>
<p>It closed the distance. Two feet taller than me, and I was a notch taller than average. The point of the giant bird mask came dangerously close as I swung the tire iron, bending my legs as I swung low, to strike it in the knee.</p>
<p>I had only a moment to register the fact that it wasn’t reacting before it drew a hand out of the layered covering of hides. A <em>mitt</em> of a hand, gray-skinned, with knobby knuckles, and fingernails that were just long enough they were starting to curl, almost rectangular. Dirty, uneven, frayed.</p>
<p>I swung again, a two-handed grip on the iron, aiming for the hand.</p>
<p>I might as well have struck another tire iron, for all it mattered. The weapon bounced off the hand, the hand was knocked back, and then it clawed at my face. I twisted partially away, keeping it from getting my eyes, and felt the pain in my cheek, instead. I backed away, and my scarf stayed. Caught in the ragged ends of the nails.</p>
<p>The wind was cold against my face as I backed up. I started to head back in the direction of the rest stop, but the thing circled around me, moving past me, until it was positioned to cut me off.</p>
<p>My scarf was caught by the wind, flapping mercilessly, until it tore free, disappearing over the dividing line of the highway.</p>
<p>I raised the tire iron again, drawing closer. It, in turn, drew one arm out from beneath the hides. I drew back a step, and it kept the hand out a moment before returning it to shelter.</p>
<p>“Rose,” I spoke, “Hey, Rose. You gotta help me out here.”</p>
<p>The mirror was silent.</p>
<p>I backed away, and it moved, approaching with long strides that covered the distance with surprising speed.</p>
<p>I stopped, and it stopped.</p>
<p>“Don’t want me to go to the rest stop,” I murmured. There was a hitch in my voice. “Don’t want me to go back to the car. Where am I supposed to go? This way?”</p>
<p>I checked the way was clear, then took a step out onto the highway. It reacted, but only barely. Tensing. When I took another step, it followed. Letting me go, but not letting me <em>escape</em>.</p>
<p>“No way,” I said. Taking a step to the side, so I was as off the road as I could get without standing in the snowbank. “I get what you’re after. You want me to get hit by a car or something.”</p>
<p>The thing remained silent. Waiting. The perfectly round eye sockets stared at me.</p>
<p>I swung, aiming for surprise, directing the iron at the skull.</p>
<p>It caught the iron mid-swing. I tried to wrench the weapon free and failed.</p>
<p>Another hand emerged from beneath the hides. I had to let go of the weapon and back away before it could claw at me.</p>
<p>It took a half-step forward to follow. It dropped the tire iron onto the road, where the snow muffled the sound.</p>
<p>Standing still, waiting for this thing to make a move, I could feel my legs getting colder. I wasn’t wearing long johns. Boxer briefs and jeans, leaving my legs as the least covered part of my body. The cold highlighted the tension in my legs, where my earlier pace had stressed muscles I tended to leave unused.</p>
<p>“How does this end, then?” I asked. “We wait out here by the side of the road until I freeze to death?”</p>
<p>I paced, watching how it followed. The knobby, long-fingered hand came out as I drew too close.</p>
<p>There was a hint of hysteria in my voice as I spoke, “Can’t go forward, can’t go back. I won’t go left.  Will you let me go right?”</p>
<p>I edged towards the snowbank, to test. A ditch, then fields. The strong wind had blown the worst of the snow away. It wouldn’t be too deep.</p>
<p>I took another step. It moved to follow, though it let me create a bit of distance.</p>
<p>Slowly, I climbed over the snowbank. It continued to let me build up a bit of distance.</p>
<p>I hit the ditch, where some stubborn tall grass stuck up here and there, and hopped over the shallowest part, where the wind had driven snow off of the ice that had frozen in the recess.</p>
<p>The hop hadn’t inspired a sudden attack. Briefly turning my back, too, seemed like it was fairly safe.</p>
<p>That in mind, when I found flat ground under my feet again, I <em>ran</em>.</p>
<p>The field was flat, the ground hard, and the snow only ankle deep. The deep treads of my boots gave me the traction I needed to find my pace. When the spaces filled up with snow, the snow-on-snow traction was still sufficient for me to maintain a good pace.</p>
<p>I slipped, but my other foot was already coming forward. I felt a <em>twang</em> in my back as I used the leg to thrust myself back up to a fully upright position. I wasn’t unfamiliar with the feeling. I’d feel it tomorrow, if I made it that long.</p>
<p>A quick glance back indicated it was following with those same long, steady strides as before. Running was letting me create some distance.</p>
<p>Across the field, away from the highway, away from the car and the rest stop.</p>
<p>I was fully aware of what was going on. I knew it was intentional, and that this was as good a way of having me die in a perfectly plausible manner as keeping me in the middle of the highway, where a car could clip me.</p>
<p>Thing was, I’d never been able to sit still while under stress. I couldn’t bring myself to stand beside the side of the road and get cold.</p>
<p>Fear was taking my breathing and heartbeat up a few notches, which was hurting more than it was helping. There was a frantic note to my breathing as I panted, my legs ached, and my thoughts were a jumble.</p>
<p>“Rose,” I gasped out the name. I fumbled for the mirror, but my hands were frozen. I got a grip on the bar that was supposed to fix the mirror to the ceiling and pulled it out.</p>
<p>“-here.”</p>
<p>Her voice was faint, tiny, and muffled, cutting off as though someone had reached out to muffle her.</p>
<p>Not someone, but <em>something</em>. Fog, again, had clouded the mirror. I wiped it with my glove. I saw only a momentary glimpse of her.</p>
<p>Letting it get damp, then letting it get warm, both were mucking it up. I held it, letting it cool off, and tried to keep it facing down, so snow wouldn’t settle on the surface.</p>
<p>I kept running. I prayed for a side street, a side road, a <em>house</em>. Shelter. Something to indicate I wouldn’t keep running into the wilderness until I could no longer move. The snow got deeper as I approached tree cover, where the wind wasn’t as strong. My pace began to slow, with nothing of import in sight.</p>
<p>I could feel a sick feeling in my gut, a combination of fear, despair, and the exhaustion of running.</p>
<p>I saw a figure up ahead, through the tree cover.</p>
<p>A quick glance back showed me the other one was still following. Closing the gap.</p>
<p>“Hello!” I called out, and I was surprised at how hoarse my voice was, my throat made raw by the heavy breathing of frozen, dry air. “Help me!”</p>
<p>The figure pushed through the cover of branches.</p>
<p>A bird skull, a covering of overlapping hides, bleached white and stained, and a heavy wreath of branches around the neck and shoulders, like a nest.</p>
<p>I stopped in my tracks. When I took in my surroundings, my vision swam, struggling to make the adjustment from the narrow focus on where I was going and where my feet were landing to the broader environment.</p>
<p>There, in the distance, in a gap between neat rows of trees. A third, with the hides forming a hood over the bird skull. Shorter than the others.</p>
<p>I turned to head for the widest gap I could make out, and they all moved, not to close the distance to me, but to cut me off. The calf-deep snow didn’t slow them down. Even if it did, they had a longer stride, and they weren’t getting tired.</p>
<p>I pushed on, moving towards the gap, forcing myself to run. They continued to follow, but I made it between the ones with the antlers and the wreath.</p>
<p>Backtracking, almost. I needed to devote a second to getting my bearings, but I had to keep running.</p>
<p>“Rose,” I said.</p>
<p>I heard only a whisper of a noise. I wiped the mirror against the side of my leg, mid-run.</p>
<p>I came face to face with another of the bird-skulls, not looking carefully enough for the white skull and white hides against the snowy background. It clawed at me, backhanded, and dashed the mirror out of my hands. I fell, a result of the combined impact, pain and surprise, landing just beside the flecks of blood he’d clawed from my hand. My glove was cut, the skin around it exposed, and a line of blood was nestled in the center. Bewildered, I watched as the skin parted and joined together, as I opened and closed my hand.</p>
<p>The wind blew, and I heard the flapping of the hides moving. Others were drawing closer.</p>
<p>The one that had just attacked me wore cords strung between hides, each with a long, narrow bone hanging from it.</p>
<p>The others were approaching, with some coming from a distance. All around me, there were clusters of evergreens, branches hanging heavy with ice and snow, and there were patches of grass. One clearing, where a pond had frozen over.</p>
<p>Slowly, I made my way to my feet.</p>
<p>I tested different directions, to see how they would react.</p>
<p>This time, they weren’t keen on letting me move towards any open ground. Clusters of trees, the pond, and areas where the snow had piled higher.</p>
<p>The pond, then. I made my way over, my wounded hand pressed to my chest by my other hand.</p>
<p>No mirror, no Rose.</p>
<p>Frozen earth crunched under my boots as I made my way to the frozen pond. Every footstep <em>hurt</em>.</p>
<p>Were they wanting me to try to cross? Was that the plan?</p>
<p>I sat by the bank instead.</p>
<p>I looked at the bird masks that had gathered formed a loose three-quarter circle around me.</p>
<p>“This okay with you bastards?” I asked. “Can I sit? You like this?”</p>
<p>The hides flapped in the wind.</p>
<p>“Motherfuckers,” I said. I moved my hands up to my armpits, squishing them beneath my arms. I could feel the pain in my wounded hand. My cheek felt tight where I’d been scratched.</p>
<p>I kicked at the ice on the pond. Methodical, careful strikes delivered with the heels of my boots, to break up the surface.</p>
<p>It took a good fifteen hits before the cracks spread.</p>
<p>I used the toe of my boot to flip one large, two-inch thick piece of ice out of the way.</p>
<p>“Please tell me reflections in water work too.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” she responded.</p>
<p>“You see them?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“I went to a lot of trouble to talk to you,” I said, trying to ignore the looming individuals who were standing behind me. “I need more than one word answers.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to say.”</p>
<p>“You’re not in <em>immediate</em> danger. You’re not in pain, I hope. They’re after me, not you. So I’m hoping you’re thinking a little clearer than I am.”</p>
<p>“Not- not really.”</p>
<p>I sighed.</p>
<p>A minute passed. I could feel the chill creeping in.</p>
<p>“I don’t think they’ve got brains in those skulls,” I said. “Someone gave them orders.”</p>
<p>“Makes sense. Who?”</p>
<p>“Does it matter? I think those orders are why they’re behaving this way. Barring my path to keep me from certain areas. Driving me away from shelter, wearing me out.”</p>
<p>“They want plausible deaths.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Newspaper runs an article on page seven about the poor idiot who broke down by the side of the highway, wandered into the middle lane and got hit, or got lost in the woods. No mention of eerily patient bird-masked antler horrors. They interview my landlord, he mentions I was acting funny, and cousin Kathryn is the one who wakes up with spooky visions, a few hours later.”</p>
<p>“Go for an <em>implausible</em> death?”</p>
<p>“Not sure how I’m supposed to do that,” I said. I sighed, and my teeth chattered as the air passed through my lips. “All I can figure is they don’t want to claw me to death.”</p>
<p>“Molly was clawed to death,” Rose said.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes.</p>
<p>“They don’t want to kill two of us the same way,” she said. “Molly was partially eaten, too, but I don’t think these guys are the type.”</p>
<p>“You can see them?”</p>
<p>“End of the pond,” she said. “There’s a reflection.”</p>
<p>I looked.</p>
<p>Another one had joined the ranks at some point, where I hadn’t been looking. Taller than the others, with two more bird skulls worn on sloped shoulders. He stood on the ice.</p>
<p>I bowed my head again. “How many?”</p>
<p>“No idea.”</p>
<p>“Is this where everything ends for me, Rose? Do I die here, an ignoble death, with the mantle passing to Kathryn? Do you carry on?”</p>
<p>“As a ghost?”</p>
<p>“As a whatever.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I think I’m bound to you, somehow.”</p>
<p>“Right,” I said.</p>
<p>I forced myself to my feet. I was shaking, now.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I’m not,” I said. “I just <em>hate</em> sitting still.”</p>
<p>“You need a plan.”</p>
<p>“Any <em>fucking</em> ideas?” I asked.</p>
<p>There was no response.</p>
<p>I moved, and they moved as well. Organizing, spreading out. I backed up, and they advanced.</p>
<p>I sat down again, regretting it instantly. Standing would be harder.</p>
<p>The three-masked one slowly removed one mask from its shoulder.</p>
<p>It dawned on me.</p>
<p>That mask was going to be <em>mine</em>.</p>
<p>My mind warred with my body. Every last part of me hated to sit still, was restless in the face of stress. But my body was starting to give up.</p>
<p>I was so tired, I felt like I had gone two straight days without sleep.</p>
<p>“No glimmers of light nearby?”</p>
<p>“Not really.”</p>
<p>“Define <em>really</em>.”</p>
<p>“I see patches of light. I think… even regular surfaces, they reflect light to <em>some</em> degree.”</p>
<p>“Sure. Listen, what I need to know is… which direction do I run?”</p>
<p>“Run?”</p>
<p>“I’ll take a guess, if you have to give me one, Rose. Just lie convincingly. I’ll lose heart if I don’t buy it.”</p>
<p>“Your three o’clock,” she said.</p>
<p>Nothing more. No details. No explanation on why it was the right direction.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I needed to run, but there weren’t any meaningful gaps, now.</p>
<p>If I assumed these things were <em>stupid</em>, that they were programmed or strictly following orders… if they’d been <em>ordered</em> not to hurt me unless it was in retaliation or because there was no other way to get past me…</p>
<p>I looked back at the one that stood on the ice.</p>
<p>Slowly, carefully, I stepped back onto the frozen pond.</p>
<p>The ice cracked. I drenched one boot. It was waterproof enough that only a trace of the freezing water touched my foot.</p>
<p>Too close to the break I’d made to talk to Rose.</p>
<p>“Blake?”</p>
<p>I circled around a bit further. The bird-masks at the leftmost edge began to take longer strides, to move around and cut me off.</p>
<p>This time, I stepped onto the ice with care, a distance from the break I’d made before.</p>
<p>I backed up, towards the one with three masks on the far end of the pond.</p>
<p>I watched as others stepped forward, maintaining a roughly even distance. I saw as the one with the wreath avoided the crack in the ice.</p>
<p>Each step was a careful one as I made my way towards the middle of the pond. I transferred my weight with care, doing my best to avoid putting too much weight on one point at once. The three-masked one moved to cut me off, keeping me on the ice.</p>
<p>I heard the faintest cracking sounds. Around me, not <em>them</em>.</p>
<p>I made a beeline straight for three-masks.</p>
<p>I saw the hands come out.</p>
<p>Woman’s hands, oddly enough, with flecks of nail polish still on one. Wizened, worn, abused, with bits of nail splintered off where they had maybe scraped violently against something.</p>
<p>The faint cracking sound intensified. The stress of my weight was going to break the ice right beneath me.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I ran, and the ones behind me ran to follow.</p>
<p>The ice didn’t break beneath them. My heart sank.</p>
<p>I collided head-on with three-masks, and felt her stab at my shoulders through my coat, clawing through fabric with no heed for her own well being. Frenzied, violent and noisy after the almost tranquil quiet.</p>
<p>I broke away, as best as I could, and she followed. I tried to find a path that would get her to back off, give me <em>two seconds</em>, and she refused to give it to me.</p>
<p>Up until I stepped onto the ice at the edge and it broke, soaking my boot. This time, it lapped around the skin at my calf, soaking my jeans. A glance back verified the others had stopped when I had started fighting.</p>
<p>Three-masks began stalking around, cutting off my retreat.</p>
<p>I didn’t care. Reaching down, I grabbed a snow-covered rock the size of my head, heaving at it. It was half-frozen into the earth. Prying it loose put it into the water, forcing me to get my uninjured hand wet to pick it up.</p>
<p>In one motion, full-body, I managed to heave it about three feet. I watched it bounce off the ice and slide, uselessly, towards the middle of the spread out bird-masks.</p>
<p>It lay there for a good ten seconds before the ice broke. I watched as the things plunged into the water.</p>
<p>Leaving me with only two to deal with.</p>
<p>I ran, fueled by desperation.</p>
<p>I ran, fueled by the adrenaline that pain was dumping into my body. Through shock and fear. Nothing conserved, nothing saved.</p>
<p>Thick trees tore at me, costing me my toque. My frozen hand and foot were throbbing, now, and my injured hand was so cold I couldn’t open my fist.</p>
<p>Every footstep hurt, and the only thing that kept me putting one foot in front of the other was the idea that one more of those things might appear to bar my way if I slowed down in the slightest.</p>
<p>I found the end of the trees. A strip of snow. A line of road.</p>
<p>Squat, short buildings, and a sign reading ‘truck inspection area’.</p>
<p>Headlights flared in my field of vision, blindingly bright.</p>
<p>I staggered forward, collapsing onto my hands and knees. I could hear a vehicle’s door open.</p>
<p>Fuck, fuck, fuck. If they came-</p>
<p>But there was nothing. The wind stirred swirls of snow across the road,</p>
<p>“Good god, man,” a deep voice said. “What the hell did you get yourself into?”</p>
<p>I thought about explaining, about the <em>others</em>. I’d sound crazy.</p>
<p>I thought about making an excuse, saying I was chased by some delinquent kids. It would get the police involved, and it would delay me.</p>
<p>“Car broke down,” I said, a little numb. “I thought I’d take a shortcut, got turned around. I- I- panicked. I started running and got hurt.”</p>
<p>“We’ll get you an ambulance, not to worry.”</p>
<p>“No. No, it’s not as bad as it looks. I’d be embarrassed,” I lied. I wasn’t sure where things stood. If they came after me while I was in the hospital, I wasn’t sure I’d be able to <em>walk</em>, let alone run.</p>
<p>“You look nearly dead.”</p>
<p>“I need to warm up. That’s all.”</p>
<p>I glanced over my shoulder, nervously. The things still hadn’t made an appearance. They should have caught up by now.</p>
<p>“If I don’t get you to a hospital, and you die-”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to die,” I said, not sure if I was lying. “Drop me off at the rest stop, I’ll warm up and get food. I’ll hitch a ride to where I need to be.”</p>
<p>“If you’re positive,” he said. “I don’t want you haunting me or anything, and I don’t want lawsuits either. I don’t make that much money.”</p>
<p>He nodded. “Sure, then. You need help getting up?”</p>
<p>“Just a bit,” I admitted.</p>
<p>We made our way around, and I climbed up into the passenger seat. The heating was already on, and I held my hands out to warm them.</p>
<p>Looking out through the windshield, I could see a trace of pink in the sky.</p>
<p>Was that a rule, here? No monsters after sunrise, or no monsters when others could see?</p>
<p>The truck pulled away, moving down the long road. I could see the rear half of the rest stop creeping into my vision.</p>
<p>I made eye contact with Rose, in the side-view mirror.</p>
<p>She looked drained, haggard. Almost worse than I did.</p>
<p>She’d broken the mirror, and it had taken something out of her. To look this drained… she’d broken the ice, or she’d helped it along. A bit of an extra push.</p>
<p>The truck driver circled the long way around, pulling into the eighteen-wheeler’s spot for the rest stop. We climbed out and made our way to the shop opening, where employees were setting up at the fast food places.</p>
<p>As the truck driver talked to some employees, negotiating a way to get me to my stop, I saw a man in the corner with an oddly crooked stance, leaning against the wall as if his limbs wouldn’t hold him up, the whites of his eyes too white as he tracked us with his gaze. Staying out of the way, almost out of sight.</p>
<p>We’d have a relatively safe way to the house, soon enough. We couldn’t get there fast enough, for the shelter or the answers we could find there.</p>`;
